      "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:The chart of the dayWhat we're watchingWhat we're readingEconomic data releases and earningsAnd just like that, everyone is a recession expert. Two weeks ago, most self-proclaimed finance experts hadn't uttered the word recession since it was fashionable in late 2022/early 2023. From late July to early August, the prevailing sentiment of those seemingly in the know was 1) Nvidia (NVDA) shares were due for another 50% move after earnings on Aug. 28; 2) a 10% year-end rally for the S&P 500; and 3) a 100% move in Nvidia's stock price in 2025. Yet here we are, with the pros scaring the heck out of everyone the past week on the potential for a recession after a \"bad\" jobs report last Friday. Two top Wall Street banks raised their recession probabilities this week, for example. These pros have voiced their concerns on TV, social media, and in research reports, but they also conveyed them to global trading desks. Markets were pushed into choppy seas as crowded AI trades such as AMD (AMD) have been dumped, with no nod to their underlying fundamentals. All this recession talk feels like BS to me, an excuse to shake out the average investor so institutional players could get back into high-flying names at cheaper prices. Everyone does know that a recession often means negative economic growth, right? Or a significant slowdown in the economy that lasts quarters or even years?So the US economy is going to go from 2. 8% second quarter GDP growth and a long period of steady expansion to slightly negative growth or worse sometime within the next six months? An economy still creating a good clip of jobs each month is going to begin producing job losses in the near future?Where is the evidence to support this? What's the trigger for it? Don't hit me up on X, formerly Twitter, and say it's interest rates because the economy has been doing just fine during this high rate period. Lost in recession BS this week was an ISM services report, which includes data on business activity, new orders, employment, and supplier deliveries. The index clocked in at 51. 4%, up from 48. 8% in June. Numbers over 50% are seen as positive for the economy. Most companies in the report said business was either flat or expanding gradually. Then, initial jobless claims totaled a seasonally adjusted 233,000 for the week — a drop of 17,000. The Street was looking for a print of around 240,000. Corporate earnings season has gone quite well too. The majority of well-known public companies are easily beating sales and profit forecasts, not shocking the masses with giant misses. Outlooks have been solid. That's recessionary? Come on!Now, I am not going to sit here and blow smoke and say everything is peachy. Many households are struggling to make ends meet because of sticky inflation, something I was reminded of when chatting with P&G's (PG) CEO Jon Moeller a week ago. I think the interview by Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma at the NYSE with Dine Brands (DIN) CEO John Peyton was also eye-opening on this front. \"It's a value war. It's a fight for share of wallet. . . . At a time when our target guest is dining out less, we have to make sure that when they do choose to dine out — IHOP or Applebee's or Fuzzy's are their first choice,\" Peyton said. The same goes for DiPalma's exclusive interview with Molson Coors (TAP) CEO Gavin Hattersley. \"Consumers [are] making different pack sizes choices,\" Hattersley said. He said this behavior has been going on \"for a while\" and is \"pretty consistent through through Q2. \"Conversations I had this past week with top leaders further shed light on these macro challenges. Disney (DIS) CFO Hugh Johnston told me demand at its theme parks tailed off in the final few weeks of the quarter. The company sees this slowdown persisting for the next few quarters. \"We certainly see consumers behaving in a way — I wouldn't call it recessionary necessarily — they're watching their pennies a little bit more,\" Johnston said. Lost in the sauce, though, was a strong quarter for Disney's streaming businesses. In a recession, people usually cut unnecessary expenses. Ralph Lauren (RL) CEO Patrice Louvet told me (video above) this when I asked him if the consumer is behaving recessionary: \"I think it's pretty clear wherever you look that the overall consumer is being pressured by the cumulative effect of inflationary pressures and interest rates. As far as our core consumer is concerned, we actually find them to be very resilient. \"The company still notched sales growth in its North American stores. All in all, you don't get the sense the economy has already jumped over a cliff and is falling to the ground. As a result, it's hard to justify some of these severe down days we have witnessed in markets this week. What appears to be unfolding is a gradual cooling in the economy that could prove short-lived, especially if the Fed cuts rates, as Cognizant (CTSH) CEO Ravi Kumar told me on my Opening Bid podcast this week. Labor market developments of late \"seem more consistent with post-reopening normalization and gradual rates drag than any current shock or accelerating weakness but the risk is present,\" said 22V Research strategist Peter Williams in a note this week. I think that's a fair assessment. What's not fair is all this recession hysteria talk.

      "Investors waiting for a pullback in Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock may believe the opportunity has arrived. The stock has pulled back since peaking at just above $140 per share in June. Investors should also remember it has lost more than half of its value twice since 2018. However, the artificial intelligence (AI) stock is up nearly 2,400% over the last five years. Indeed, Nvidia has earned much of this growth thanks to its leadership in the AI chip space. But amid a sell-off in tech stocks, should investors start buying now or hold out for a lower stock price?Nvidia began as a gaming company and is involved in fields such as automotive and professional visualization. More recently, the stock has shot into the stratosphere thanks to its work in becoming the dominant company in the AI chip space. Although Advanced Micro Devices, Qualcomm, and others have offered competing products, Nvidia is the technical leader, dominating at least 80% of the market. Also, the $30,000 or more price tag for its AI chips is far above what its peers can command in this market. Still, as mentioned, the stock sold off in recent weeks. Besides a general sell-off in the tech sector, the Department of Justice has hit Nvidia with multiple investigations regarding its dominance in the AI chip sector, according to The Information. The same publication also reported that design flaws will delay the launch of its next-generation Blackwell AI chip. This may have a broader impact across the tech market as cloud providers such as Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft may count on this technology to deliver some of their productivity gains to investors. Admittedly, its financials may experience little direct impact. The AI chip market is expected to grow at a 38% compound annual growth rate through 2032, and Nvidia and its peers have struggled to keep up with demand. In the first quarter of fiscal 2025, Nvidia's revenue grew 262% to $26 billion. Also, while we will not know how it performs in fiscal Q2 until its August 28 earnings release, it expects $28 billion in quarterly revenue at the midpoint, which would amount to 107% yearly growth. Nvidia's problem is that its stock is arguably still priced for perfection, and the lawsuits and developmental delays indicate it falls short of that standard. Given its rapid growth, the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 59 may seem justified. However, other valuation metrics point to an expensive stock. Its 31 price-to-sales (P/S) ratio exceeds AMD's sales multiple of just over 9. Also, its 50 price-to-book value ratio is far above AMD's book value multiple of 4. Although Nvidia's technical lead calls for a premium, such levels seem excessive, considering Nvidia's challenges. When it comes to buying Nvidia, the answer may be both to buy now and hold out for a lower price. Here's why. Due to Nvidia's dominance in the AI chip market, revenue and profits will likely continue to rise rapidly, even with the delayed launch of the Blackwell chips. Thus, it will probably remain a long-term winner at just about any price. Still, investors should employ dollar-cost average (DCA) investing instead of purchasing all at once. Considering Nvidia's recent challenges and elevated multiples, the chances of a further near-term pullback are high. Also, as mentioned, Nvidia stock has lost more than 50% of its value twice since 2018. Hence, investors cannot rule out such a decline from happening again. DCA investing can serve as a compromise between owning Nvidia stock without denying oneself an opportunity to buy at a lower price.

      "Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC) stock has been battered and beaten this month, and August has only just begun. The company's share price has plunged 34% since July 30 amid a sell-off affecting countless stocks. Growing fears of a recession and dismal earnings from Intel sent investors into a panic. While I firmly believe in holding through a market dip rather than selling a tech stock like Intel, it doesn't necessarily mean now is the time to buy more. The above chart shows that despite recent declines, Intel's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is significantly higher than other tech stocks. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) offer similar exposure to budding markets like artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing yet are trading at a better value than Intel. In addition to Intel's stock being poorly valued, its latest quarter (the second quarter of 2024) missed revenue and earnings-per-share (EPS) expectations. Meanwhile, recent earnings from AMD and Alphabet illustrate a positive growth trajectory. So forget Intel and consider buying these two millionaire-maker stocks instead. AMD's stock has tumbled 24% over the last month as tech stocks have fallen out of favor. However, the company boasts a long history of growth that has seen it create many millionaires, with its share price up more than 3,000% since 2014. The company has enjoyed immense success over the years, taking on a crucial role in the chip market. AMD's hardware powers products across tech, from game consoles like Sony's PlayStation 5 to consumer-built PCs, laptops, data centers, and AI models. As a result, AMD is easily one of the best stocks to gain exposure to different areas of tech. AMD's closest competitors are Nvidia and Intel, and the three companies are fierce rivals in AI chips. Nvidia dominates the industry, while Intel has yet to make real headway. However, recent earnings indicate AMD's AI division is on a promising growth path and gaining on Nvidia. In Q2 2024, AMD's revenue rose 9% year over year, beating expectations by $120 million. Meanwhile, earnings per share of $0. 69 outperformed estimates by $0. 01. The quarter benefited from a 115% year-over-year revenue increase in its AI-focused data center segment and a 49% rise in client sales. AMD's gaming segment suffered from reductions in semi-custom chip sales, with revenue falling 59%. However, that didn't stop solid growth in the quarter as the company pivoted its business toward AI. Operating income for the period hit $269 million, significantly improving on the $20 million in losses reported a year ago. AMD's Q2 2024 proves it's enjoying impressive returns on its hefty investment in AI and gaining in the industry. Its quarterly free cash flow has soared 81% year to date, increasing its spending power. In addition to being a better-valued stock, AMD is a no-brainer buy over Intel right now. Alphabet's share price has tumbled 17% since early July, in tandem with the tech sell-off. However, its forward P/E of 21 makes it one of the best-valued stocks in tech and too good to pass up. Meanwhile, like AMD, recent earnings hint at a lucrative future for the tech giant. The Google company reported its Q2 2024 earnings at the end of July, with revenue rising 14% year over year to $85 billion. The quarter saw solid growth in advertising, with sales increasing by 11%. However, Google Cloud delivered the most gains, with revenue soaring 28% year over year and beating competitors Amazon Web Services and Microsoft in cloud growth for the period. At the start of the year, Alphabet seemed to fall behind its cloud rivals, but earnings prove it's quickly catching up. In addition to impressive revenue growth, Google Cloud's operating income nearly tripled and hit more than $1 billion for the first time. Success in cloud computing is promising for Alphabet as it diversifies its earnings, allowing it to lean less on advertising and secure a promising role in AI. Alphabet has a long history of making people rich and undoubtedly created more than a few millionaires, with its stock up 470% over the last decade. With its bargain price, Alphabet's stock is worth picking up over Intel and is an excellent way to invest in tech.

      "The adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) is ongoing, but some investors fear the trend is getting a little long in the tooth. Fears about the economy and weakness in AI stocks helped push the Nasdaq Composite into correction territory earlier this month, and with valuations stretched, some believe there could be further declines ahead. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has become the poster child for the generative AI trend. When the company reports its results later this month, it's not hyperbole to suggest that Wall Street will be sitting on the edge of its seat, hoping to gain insight into the state of AI adoption. Nvidia's sales have skyrocketed since the start of 2023, driving the stock up 619% (as of this writing), though it's currently more than 22% off its high. With so much riding on Nvidia's quarterly results, investors are wondering whether the recent stock price decline represents a buying opportunity ahead of the company's highly anticipated financial report. Let's review the available evidence. The biggest driver for Nvidia over the past 18 months has been the rapid adoption of generative AI by cloud infrastructure providers best positioned to monetize AI. Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are the gold standard for these applications. As a result, cloud infrastructure providers, including Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Alphabet's Google Cloud, have been upgrading their data centers to provide the computational horsepower needed to run AI. Even Meta Platforms has jumped on the bandwagon, creating one of the leading large language models (LLMs) so it can profit from AI. Demand for Nvidia's AI-centric processors remains robust among the cloud leaders, and each has highlighted plans for higher capex spending to support their AI aspirations. This bodes well for Nvidia in the current quarter. There's further evidence that suggests Nvidia's results will be robust. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), otherwise known as AMD, is one of Nvidia's biggest rivals in the GPU space. The company reported its second-quarter results late last month, and the strength of its AI-related sales caught many market watchers off guard. While revenue grew 9% year over year and beat expectations, its data center sales surged to a record $2. 58 billion, up 115%, driven higher by soaring demand for AI. Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ARM) creates the CPU cores found in many of Nvidia's AI processors, and its results were similarly upbeat. For its fiscal 2025 first quarter (ended June 30), Arm reported its fourth consecutive quarter of record results. The company generated record revenue of $939 million, up 39% year over year, the result of record license revenue driven by \"the proliferation of AI. \"Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) supplies server and storage solutions featuring next-generation AI processors from Nvidia and others. For the company's fiscal 2024 fourth quarter (ended June 30), revenue of $5. 3 billion grew 143% year over year and 38% quarter over quarter. Despite its parabolic growth rate, management noted Supermicro continued to be hamstrung by short-term \"supply chain bottlenecks. \"The thread that runs through these AI players is that demand remained strong in the most recent quarter, driven by the secular tailwind of AI. This suggests Nvidia's sales should be similarly robust. There are other reasons to believe Nvidia stock could have additional upside from here. Research by analysts at Bank of America shows that in the 12 months following a stock-split announcement, stock-split stocks gained 25%, on average, compared to just 12% for the S&P 500. Since Nvidia announced its stock split on May 22, the stock has actually fallen 19% (as of this writing), as fears regarding the state of the economy overshadowed the tailwinds of AI. If history is any indicator, Nvidia still has plenty of double-digit upside potential ahead. For investors looking to make a fast buck, Nvidia is likely not the stock for you. As the recent stock chart shows, Nvidia has been -- and will continue to be -- a volatile stock. While investors who bought last year are likely sitting on triple-digit gains, those who bought last month could be down more than 22%. This helps to illustrate a timeless investing truth: It's best to buy shares in the best companies you can find and hold them for three to five years, as you're less likely to suffer the impact of short-term volatility. For those wondering whether Nvidia stock will go up or down after its upcoming financial report, your guess is as good as mine. I sent my crystal ball to the shop years ago, but it still hasn't come back. Furthermore, anyone who professes to know what will happen in the days or weeks that follow is being less than truthful. If I were to hazard a guess -- and that's all it would be -- I suspect Nvidia will report another quarter of record sales. Analysts' consensus estimates are calling for revenue of $28. 52 billion, slightly ahead of Nvidia's guidance of $28 billion. However, much of how the stock price reacts in the wake of the report will depend on the company's profitability and Nvidia's forward-looking guidance. It's important to take a step back and look at the big picture. Nvidia's GPUs are the gold standard for AI processing, and while there's always the threat of competition, no heir apparent has emerged. Most experts believe it's still early innings for generative AI as adoption continues to ramp up. Even the most conservative estimates suggest that generative AI will be a trillion-dollar market, with some forecasts multitudes higher. Nvidia stock trades at a premium of 38 times earnings (as of this writing), but the company's triple-digit growth, industry-leading position, and long track record show that it's worth every penny. My advice to you is this: If you believe -- like I do -- that AI has a long way to go and Nvidia will maintain its dominance in the market, then buy Nvidia stock and hold on for dear life.

      "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks To Buy According to Financial Media. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) stands against the other artificial intelligence stocks recommended by financial media. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has now become a technology that most people are increasingly familiar with. With AI seeping into almost every aspect of life, from the ads you see on social media apps to the autonomous driving cars many consumers are shifting to. It's not an overstatement to say that AI has become part and parcel of everyday life for every person using technology today. Considering the widespread use and application of AI technology, this area of the market has become an exciting area to invest in today. With the recent big tech companies' earnings being released, many investors are wondering what role AI is playing in the tech markets today, and how it will develop. On August 2, Databricks CEO Ali Ghodsi joined CNBC's \"The Exchange\" to discuss this very development. Here are some of his comments:\"I think what's happening is two things. On the one hand, it's macroeconomy, which has been sort of turbulent for a long period of time, and it seems to be now coming to an end, where we see it on the job market and people are seeing it on inflation and the 10-year coming down and so on. On the other hand, we see AI. People are very excited, they know it's gonna absolutely change the whole world, and that huge investments have been done by the hyperscalers in AI. But for us as a company, we've been investing in data and AI for the 10 years, and you know we see a steady growth revenue and customers getting value out of it, but theres been a huge deployment of capital. . . I think AI is gonna be amazing, it's gonna keep providing value. \"Ghodsi's comments clarify the market's current opinion on AI, namely that this is an area of tech that cannot be ignored and must be invested in to the maximum. However, in light of such a market opinion, many investors may be beginning to wonder whether the huge amounts of investments being made in AI are justified or whether we are merely in what some may call an \"AI bubble\" that is definitely going to burst. Considering the immense value to be found in AI, though, many investors believe that such huge deployments of capital are, in fact, justified. Considering the above, it's unsurprising that several big tech companies are part of the rat race to invest in and develop AI technologies. However, one notable absence in most lists of the best AI stocks to buy that are being made by financial media reporters is that of Apple. Many investors are beginning to take note of the fact that it is lagging behind other big tech companies that are rapidly developing AI tech. On August 6, Lightshed Partners' Walter Piecyk's shared his view on the smartphone maker's AI moves on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\". \"I signed up as a developer for the latest development or the latest release of iOS 18. I've been using the intelligent series - not that much better. . . There's a lot of work that's obviously gonna be done between now and when this is formally released. I just don't see it, for this year and for next year having some a big impact. \"Investors may be better served by shifting to purer AI plays. For this reason, we have compiled a list of the best AI stocks to buy according to financial media, to offer insights into what companies are actually doing well in the AI space today. Our list includes some of the best AI stocks to buy, according to analysts, and some of the companies offering the top AI SEO tools in 2024 as well.

      "We recently published a list of Jim Cramer is Talking About These 10 Stocks as Markets Rebound. Since Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) ranks 1st on the list, it deserves a deeper look. Jim Cramer in his latest program on CNBC talked about the latest rebound in the markets followed by a major selloff on Monday, saying we can “fret” about the interest rates, jobs market or mortgage rates, or we can just buy the stocks of “tremendous” companies and hold on to them. “Stock prices have become so dependent on the macro, the carry trade, the Fed chatter, that it’s impossible to give you a pat answer even as I’ve told you over and over again that corporate America is doing much better than anyone would expect at this point in the cycle,” Cramer said. Cramer lamented yet again that people believe a 25bps decline in interest rates could somehow “motivate” people to increase spending and on these hopes they often buy “phony” ETFs. Cramer also said that the Fed won’t begin to cut rates until it sees consumers “rebelling” against higher prices forcing companies to roll back price increases to pre-COVID levels. Jim Cramer believes we now have an “empowered consumer” who is willing to make choices and choose options that are cheaper and better. ” He said that during the pandemic, amid higher liquidity, people were willing to accept higher prices, but not anymore. For this article we watched several latest programs of Jim Cramer and picked 10 stocks he’s talking about. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) impressed Wall Street with solid second-quarter results amid strong data center revenue. Data center revenue in the period grew 49% year over year. But can Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) continue gaining in the coming months? Analysts are hopeful amid the launch of its Instinct™ MI300 Series accelerators that are designed for AI and HPC workloads.  The new chip competes with Nvidia’s H100 AI chip. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) now plans to release new AI chips annually, including the MI325X in Q4 this year, the MI350 in 2025, and the MI400 in 2026. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) said MI350 would be a competitor to Nvidia’s Blackwell. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) data center business doubled its revenue but this growth was not at the cost of profits. The segment’s operating income increased by 405% compared to the year-earlier period. However, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD)  data center business is still very small compared with NVDA. It generated about $2. 8 billion in revenue vs. $22. 6 billion in quarterly revenue for NVDA.  But Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD)'s  CPU and GPU businesses are also thriving. Ryzen CPU sales increased 49% year over year and slightly quarter over quarter. Although gaming revenue declined 59% due to decreased PlayStation and Xbox sales, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD)  Radeon 6000 GPUs saw a year-over-year sales increase. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD)  is trading 17% below its 3-year average P/E ratio. The company is estimated to grow its EPS by 43% in the long term, compared to 33% for Nvidia. During the third quarter, its revenue growth is expected to come in at 15% on a QoQ basis.  Amid growth forecasts based on new chips and an expected increase in AI spending by other companies, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) forward P/E of 38 makes the stock undervalued at the current levels. Meridian Contrarian Fund stated the following regarding Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:“Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a global semiconductor chip maker specializing in central processing units (CPUs), which are considered the core component of most computing devices, and graphics processing units (GPUs), which accelerate operations running on CPUs. We invested in 2018 when it was a mid-cap value stock plagued by many years of underperformance due to lagging technology and lost market hi share versus competitors Intel and Nvidia. Our research identified that changes and investments made by current management under CEO Lisa Su had, over several years, finally resulted in compelling technology that positioned AMD as a stronger competitor to Nvidia and that its latest products were superior to Intel’s. We invested on the the belief that AMD’s valuation at that that time did not reflect the potential for its technology leadership to generate significant market share gains and improved profits. This thesis has been playing out for several years. During the quarter, AMD unveiled more details about its upcoming GPU products for the AI market. The stock reacted positively to expectations that AMD’s GPU servers will be a viable alternative to Nvidia. Although we pared back our exposure to AMD into strength as part of our risk-management practice, we maintained a position in the stock. We believe AMD will continue to gain share in large and growing markets and is reasonably valued relative to the potential for significantly higher earnings. ”Overall Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) ranks 1st on Insider Monkey’s list titled Jim Cramer is Talking About These 10 Stocks as Markets Rebound.

      "There's no denying Nvidia has been the centerpiece of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution thus far. Its technology is used in the vast majority of the world's AI platforms simply because it offers the most computing power. And Nvidia shares have performed accordingly since the movement got going in earnest early last year. As is the case with any other industry, however, time is driving changes on the AI front. Nvidia is no longer the market's top opportunity. This title is shifting toward Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE: TSM), which is arguably better positioned to capitalize on the next chapter of AI's growth story. Nvidia isn't doomed. But it would be naïve to not recognize that most of AI's easy money has already been made. Competition is heating up. Intel and Advanced Micro Devices are stepping up their games. Price wars are underway. There's an often overlooked but important detail about the AI hardware business you must understand, however. That is, chipmakers like the aforementioned Nvidia and AMD usually don't manufacture their own chips. They typically outsource such work to third-party \"contract\" manufacturers that are capable of fabricating this silicon to its designers' specifications. Taiwan Semiconductor is one of these contract manufacturers. Indeed, it's the biggest name in the business. It's estimated to manufacture on the order of two-thirds of the world's semiconductors and associated circuitry, and an even greater share when just looking at the planet's high-performance chip market. This might help drive the point home: Advanced Micro Devices as well as Nvidia are both confirmed customers of Taiwan Semiconductor. Intel continues to invest in the construction of its own foundries, although it's forged a developmental partnership with Taiwan Semiconductor to do so. Connect the dots. Taiwan Semiconductor may actually be the technological heart and soul of the global AI revolution. And it's not limited to data centers. As time marches on, AI computing work is making its way toward end users, and end users' mobile phones in particular. Apple's newest processor -- the A17 found in the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max -- is capable of handling generative AI tasks on the device itself rather than in the cloud, where most generative AI work is presently done. It's not just Apple wading into on-device artificial intelligence waters, either. Qualcomm's newest high-performance Snapdragon 8 (Gen 3) mobile processors can handle the same kind of load on mobile devices. Apple as well as Qualcomm both also utilize Taiwan Semiconductor's chip-manufacturing services. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing doesn't make every chip used by the aforementioned outfits, for the record, nor does it manufacture every AI chip the world's currently using or will use in the future. It's likely losing market share as other players ramp up their capacity to crank this silicon out, in fact. Intel in particular is showing the potential to become a serious competitor to Taiwan Semiconductor. There's still more upside here than not, however, despite the prospect of shrinking market share. Market research outfit Skyquest suggests the artificial intelligence hardware market is set to grow at an annualized pace of 15. 5% through 2031, while the mobile AI market is likely to grow at a compound yearly rate of nearly 27% for the same time frame. In this vein, the analyst community believes Taiwan Semiconductor's top line is set to nearly double between last year and 2026, as the AI chipmaking industry gels. So why is this stock down more than 20% just since its July peak (with many other artificial intelligence names down similarly)? That's got more to do with the market environment than anything else. Investors finally began realizing last month that a few too many stocks had reached too-frothy valuations. The disappointing jobs report for July released on Friday of last week didn't help either, leading the crowd to presume lingering economic weakness is on the horizon. And maybe it is. Don't lose perspective, though. Even in a tough economic environment most chip brands are still going to need new silicon. And most of them are still in no position to make much (if any) of it themselves. They'll still need Taiwan Semiconductor to make it for them. Indeed, economic weakness might even stifle capital expenditures on new foundries, making a proven, cost-effective foundry like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing all the more important to the AI business's biggest players.

Forget Nvidia: Buy This Magnificent Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Instead was originally published by The Motley Fool\n",
      "The artificial intelligence (AI) boom is well underway, and there may be no company that's benefited from it more than Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). For years, the company's semiconductors have been a top choice among leading tech companies for AI processing, and now, it's paying off for Nvidia's stock. The company's share price has more than doubled over the past year, causing many investors to wonder: Where does Nvidia go from here? Here are a few thoughts on the company's leading AI position and what it could mean over the next year. To understand where Nvidia might be a year from now, you need to know where it is right now -- sitting at the top of the AI hill. Nvidia holds an estimated 70% to 95% of the AI chip market and is continually innovating to hold onto its lead. The company recently released its H200 AI processor, the follow-up to its ultra-popular H100. CEO Jensen Huang says that demand is already outstripping supply. How does this AI dominance translate into a real benefit for Nvidia? The company's data center revenue -- which includes its AI chip sales -- soared 427% from the year-ago quarter in Q1 (which ended April 28), reaching $22. 6 billion. What about Nvidia's competition? It does have some worthy rivals. Advanced Micro Devices is its main competitor and shouldn't be ignored. But even the scale of AMD's AI growth is minuscule, compared to Nvidia. AMD's second-quarter (ending June 29) data center sales rose 115% to just $2. 8 billion. While impressive, it's just a fraction of Nvidia's data center revenue and far below its sales growth. Some of the world's largest tech companies made headlines recently when they reported quarterly results. Investors were interested in their revenue and earnings, but their billions of dollars in AI spending garnered lots of attention. Here's how two tech CEOs recently defended the considerable spending spree:\"I actually think all the companies that are investing are making a rational decision, because the downside of being behind is that you're out of position for like the most important technology for the next 10 to 15 years. \" Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on a recent podcast. \"When we go through a curve like this, the risk of underinvesting is dramatically greater than the risk of overinvesting for us here,\" Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said on his company's latest earnings call. According to Goldman Sachs, other tech companies are spending massive amounts of money to compete in AI, as well, and all of their collective spending will total $1 trillion over the next few years. There's no guarantee that Nvidia will benefit from these investments or that companies will continue to invest as heavily as they have over the past year. But tech companies are currently embattled in an AI land grab. Nvidia's AI chips are the best, and spending is on the rise. That puts the company in a great position over the next year. Let me state the obvious first: Nvidia is expensive. The company's shares have a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 40. 9. That's not cheap by any measure, but it's less expensive than its shares were this time last year when it had a P/E ratio of about 63. A recent pullback in the stock market -- thanks to a handful of factors, including concerns about U. S. job growth -- has pushed Nvidia's share price down about 20% over the past month. This recent dip could be an opening for investors who are bullish on AI. Nvidia's shares won't see the massive gains they've experienced over the past year. However, considering its leading AI position, along with the fact that large tech companies are ramping up AI infrastructure spending, Nvidia has the potential to outpace the market over the next year or more.

We ask that you kindly restrict your questions to two then requeue if you have any additional questions to allow others the opportunity to participate. With that, I'll turn it over to Chris. Chris Huskilson -- Chief Executive OfficerThank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. After being in the CEO role for a year, I'm more convinced than ever that our current path toward a pure-play regulated utility supports our goals to create long-term value, increase our quality of earnings, and bring increased focus to improving our execution. A year ago, I set three priority goals: to sell the renewables business, optimize the value of AY, and to get the regulated business up and running. Today, I'm pleased to announce the successful sale of our renewables business at a valuation of $2. 5 billion. As we set out to accomplish in our 2023 strategic review, we've achieved a deal at a compelling value for our platform business with strong assets and scale. As we set out to accomplish -- sorry, excuse me, this agreement between Algonquin and LS Power for the company's non-hydro renewable energy business, consisting of 2. 28 billion in cash proceeds and 220 million in an earnout agreement relating to certain wind assets. I just want to take this moment to thank the team from across Algonquin for the tireless efforts that they put in. It was a great job, team. Thank you very much. This major milestone, coupled with our previously announced support agreement to sell our Atlantica shares, delivers on our plan to transform Algonquin into a pure-play regulated utility, optimize our regulated business activities, strengthen our balance sheet, and enhance our quality of earnings. As Darren will touch on shortly, we expect to use the proceeds upon close in late '24 or early 2025 to recapitalize our balance sheet and position ourselves for future growth. We're also making progress on our goal to get the regulated business up and running. We reorganized along commodity lines to improve operational efficiency. We recently completed the implementation of our Customer First enterprise platform, which promises to deliver value to our customers and substantial efficiencies. We added three new experienced board members with extensive infrastructure and regulated utility experience. We're implementing fundamental changes to how we operate the company with increased accountability. This is the beginning of a multiyear journey to unlock the value of our regulated business. In addition, we're making changes at the executive level. Yesterday, the company appointed Sarah MacDonald as chief transformation officer. In her new role, Sarah will assume responsibility for utility operations and customer service. Sarah is a lawyer by training and has more than two decades of legal, human resources, and operational experience. She has a broad background having worked in the utility sector for more than 20 years, including roles in utility construction, as president and CEO of Emera Caribbean, and as president of TECO Services. As part of this announcement, Chief Operating Officer Johnny Johnston has left the company. I'd like to personally thank Johnny for his dedication and service and his commitment as we wish him the best for his future endeavors. As we look forward, we're focused on delivering value to our shareholders in a more self-sufficient manner. We see tremendous value in the business from investments we have made for our customers that are not yet in rates. We need to improve our recoveries, reduce our regulatory lag, and absorb our growth. As a result, we will be reducing our regulated capex for 2025. Also, as part of our objective to be more self-sufficient, the board has decided to rightsize the dividend so we're not chasing a high payout ratio and excess -- excessive equity raises. These are necessary steps that we expect to unlock more value in the long term for our shareholders. Now, let me provide more details on the business, starting with the investments not yet in rates. We currently estimate over $1 billion in assets are not yet authorized in rates or receiving optimized regulatory treatment. This represents a rare capital-light path to earnings growth. An example of this is our Sarival wastewater treatment plant in Arizona. The plant is an important and currently operating asset, enabling the local community to grow, but it's not yet in customer rates. Another is our Customer First SAP program, which, as I mentioned earlier, just completed its final implementation. Our investment in the platform has been approved in six of our smaller jurisdictions but is not yet reflected in customer rates for the majority of our utilities. Our Customer First program is a world-class platform, designed to facilitate greater operational efficiency and utility integration or improved customer service. It's worth calling out that we are now in the typical post-conversion adjustment period for these types of systems. Our system implementation, combined with our most active rate case calendar in our history, is causing some delays in our rate case filings, which we're working through. In terms of our rate case filings, I also want to call out changes to our expected regulatory calendar in a few of our jurisdictions, namely Missouri, New Hampshire, and California. In respect to these jurisdictions, we're expecting delays of one to two quarters, which will shift the beginning of our recoveries closer to 2026. These delays will, of course, impact short-term earnings. While we have some challenges in the short term, the substantial value here is a disciplined capital-light trajectory to improve returns. With that, I'll turn it over to Darren. Darren Myers -- Chief Financial OfficerThank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with the regulated services group. During the second quarter of 2024, we received the final order for our BELCO utility in Bermuda, authorizing a revenue increase totaling $33. 6 million over two years. New rates became effective on August 1, 2024. In New York, we filed a joint proposal with the New York Department of Public Service staff resolving all contested issues, and a final order is expected sometime in the third quarter. The regulated services group currently has pending 14 rate reviews, totaling $131 million as of quarter-end. Turning now to a brief update on our renewables energy group. Our construction trajectory for renewables remains on track. Our construction loan balance has fallen to $405 million due to the buyout of the New Market Solar and Shady Oaks II projects. By year-end, we expect that loan balance to round trip back up to similar level where we started the year due to the completion of construction at Carvers Creek and Clearview. I'll now turn to our financial results. Our second quarter financial performance delivered growth in each of our key financial metrics, EBITDA, adjusted net earnings, and adjusted net earnings per share, with double-digit increases compared to the same period last year. Operating profit growth for both the regulated and renewables business were largely as expected, with regulated growing 7% and renewables growing 31%. Adjusted EBITDA was $311 million, up 12% from the same period last year. Adjusted net earnings were $65. 2 million, an increase of 16%. On a per-share level, our second quarter adjusted net earnings per share was $0. 09, a 13% increase from the second quarter of last year. Let me briefly discuss individual EPS drivers. First, weather returned to a more normalized level, contributing approximately $0. 03 to the upside year over year. Second, our regulated business operating profit grew organically by $0. 02, primarily due to new rate implementations at several of the company's electric, gas, and water utilities. However, this was offset by a negative $0. 02 year over year due to last year's benefit of a one-time retroactive rate order in California. Renewables also organically grew by $0. 02, driven by contributions from new wind facilities, Deerfield II and Sandy Ridge II, brought online last year. This was offset by a negative penny due to development cost expenses, in part, as a result of the simplification of our JV entity, as discussed in prior quarters. Depreciation contributed negative $0. 02, and interest expense contributed a negative penny, excluding the impacts of our Empire bond securitization. And lastly, tax credits were a little better this year than we had projected, being flat year over year. Turning now to key financing activities. During the quarter, the company settled the purchase contracts from its green equity units as expected, issuing approximately 76. 9 million common shares for proceeds of $1. 15 billion. These proceeds were used to reduce existing indebtedness and for general corporate purposes. We ended the quarter with approximately 767 million shares issued and outstanding. With the conclusion of the equity unit remarketing and as of June 30, 2024, we have refinanced approximately $2. 5 billion of our borrowings over the trailing 12 months and we have simplified our capital structure. As Chris mentioned earlier, we are pleased to announce the sale of our renewables business. The transaction proceeds and valuation are compelling. We expect to close the sale in late 2024 or early 2025 and receive net cash proceeds of approximately $1. 6 billion after repaying construction financing and other customary adjustments. Proceeds from the renewables sale, plus our Atlantica shares, will leave us with a very strong balance sheet. In addition, as we look forward, we are making changes to be more self-sufficient. We are looking at spending capital at a level just above requisite maintenance, safety, and environmental requirements in order for the company to digest the impacts of investments already made on behalf of our customers. Once we improve our returns to a more appropriate level, we will have the opportunity to increase our capital spending in a disciplined way. With regards to our newly reduced dividend, we see our revised dividend payout as roughly 60% to 70% of our optimized core regulated earnings power on our current assets. And although we are not providing guidance at this time, as described earlier, 2025 earnings will be impacted by rate case timing. With that, I'll hand it back to Chris for some closing remarks. Chris Huskilson -- Chief Executive OfficerOK. Thank you, Darren. In summary, we've achieved several major milestones and are delivering on our plan to transform Algonquin into a pure-play regulated utility. We're reducing our capital spend and dividend to position the company for greater long-term value creation. As we look forward, we expect to have a solid balance sheet, a healthy payout ratio, a capital-light path toward earnings, and ultimately, dividend growth, all under, for the first time, a focused company with a singular business model. It's a tremendous story, and we're excited for the future. With that, we'll open the lines for calls. Operator. OperatorThank you. [Operator instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Rupert Merer from National Bank. The line is open. Rupert Merer -- AnalystHi. Yeah. Good morning, everyone. Congratulations on getting to the conclusion of that deal. Chris Huskilson -- Chief Executive OfficerThank you. Darren Myers -- Chief Financial OfficerThank you, Rupert. Rupert Merer -- AnalystSo, if I can start by asking about the net cash proceeds of 1. 6 billion, what does the walk-down look like from the sell price? How much of that difference is related to taxes, transaction fees versus construction debt repayment?Darren Myers -- Chief Financial OfficerYeah. I mean, Rupert, it's primarily the construction loans. There's very little tax friction on the deal, consistent with our original expectations. So, the majority of it would be construction loans. And then, you know, really just the transaction costs and some of, you know, the break fees on the APCo bonds would be included in that as well. Rupert Merer -- AnalystOK. Great. And that construction debt, is that debt that's currently off balance sheet or yet to be incurred on your development pipeline?Darren Myers -- Chief Financial OfficerYes. As I mentioned -- so we -- the balance is lower as of the end of Q2, but we expect it to get back to -- you know, similar to levels that it was, call it, around the 700 million mark or just below that by the end of the year as we continue to build out Clearview and Carvers. Rupert Merer -- AnalystGreat. And then on the transaction itself, can you walk us through your thoughts on the valuation? How much of this is, say, for your development pipeline versus your operating assets, and what's your perspective on the multiple that you're getting on the deal?Darren Myers -- Chief Financial OfficerYeah. Listen, we think it's an excellent multiple and a strong transaction. It's always hard to, you know, decipher what you're getting for the platform. But clearly, you know, we see this as a -- with the earnout at, you know, 12. 5 times-type multiple of next year's, you know, EBITDA, like estimated EBITDA. And, you know, without the earnout, you know, more like close to 11. 5. So, you know, really strong multiples. And so, clearly, there was value seen in, you know, what the team has built over 30 years and the strong development pipeline and just the strength of the organization. So, we're quite pleased with where that ended up. Chris Huskilson -- Chief Executive OfficerYeah. And, Rupert, I think we said all along that in order for us to get to a sale of this business, we had to see value for the development pipeline. So, you know, we haven't tried to quantify that, but it's pretty clear to us that we did get paid for that. Rupert Merer -- AnalystVery good. I'll leave it there and get back in the queue. Thank you very much. Darren Myers -- Chief Financial OfficerGreat. Thanks, Rupert. OperatorThank you. Your next question comes from the line of Sean Steuart from TD Cowen. Your line is open. Sean Steuart -- AnalystThanks. Good morning, everyone, and congrats on getting this over the line. Chris Huskilson -- Chief Executive OfficerThank you, Sean. Sean Steuart -- AnalystChris, the 60% to 70% payout ratio on EPS, am I to take it that is from the starting point 2025, post this asset sale, or is that relative to where you would expect EPS to get to as your rate cases normalize, I suppose?Darren Myers -- Chief Financial OfficerYeah, Sean. It's Darren here. Let me just -- I'll just jump in. The target payout has been set based on our current reg assets, you know, fully earning or earning, you know, closer to fully earning. You know, clearly, you know, we're -- you know, next year will be our first year as a pure-play regulated utility. We're on a multiyear journey. And as Chris highlighted through his, you know, prepared remarks, you know, we have the most active rate cases we've had in history, plus the implementation of a major system. So, you know, from a timing perspective, we do expect some delays in 2025, with improvements in 2026. But just for clarity, you know, that dividend rate has been set based on, you know, the current assets, including the billion dollars -- you know, getting recovery on that billion dollars of investments we've already made that's not in rates. Sean Steuart -- AnalystOK. And then the follow-on question there is you've indicated constrained capital investment in the regulated base and capital-light approach putting these assets that haven't been recognized into the rate base. How long do you anticipate that capital-light approach to last and how does this feed into your expectation of midterm EPS growth off the reset base?Chris Huskilson -- Chief Executive OfficerYeah. Well, certainly, it really depends on how quickly we can advance the rate cases that we need to advance and our success rate on those, but I think we're talking about a few years. I mean, that's the kind of time frame we'd be expecting. And at the end of the day, what we're really focused on doing is, you know, raising our game when it comes to how we work through things with regulators, how we actually make decisions around regulatory investments, and how we just advance this business. You know, there's a substantial amount of work going on to improve the accountability across the business and to improve the ability of our utility leaders to actually run those businesses. And all those things are going to be important parts of all this. Darren Myers -- Chief Financial OfficerYeah, Sean. We have to also -- we have to prove, just to add to what Chris is saying, that we can add more capital in a disciplined way and get appropriate returns with very little regulatory lag. And that's -- you know, I'm with Chris, there's probably a few years of restraint, but, you know, we do see growth after that. And, you know, from the kind of 2025 starting point, we see it -- an ability, really, to grow earnings without growing capital, so -- you know, just by increasing the returns and getting more efficient in the business. Sean Steuart -- AnalystUnderstood. OK. That's all I have for now. Thanks, guys. Chris Huskilson -- Chief Executive OfficerOK. Thank you. OperatorThank you. [Operator instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Nelson Ng from RBC Capital Markets. The line is open. Nelson Ng -- RBC Capital Markets -- AnalystThank you and congrats on the transaction. So, the first question, I just wanted to have a quick clarification. In terms of that 11. 5 to 12. 5 times next year's EBITDA, are -- is it roughly the run rate EBITDA of the assets, assuming that they're fully constructed and commissioned, and does it exclude the development expenses that you have within that business?Darren Myers -- Chief Financial OfficerYeah, you got it, Nelson. Nelson Ng -- RBC Capital Markets -- AnalystYeah. OK. Darren Myers -- Chief Financial OfficerYeah, you got it. Nelson Ng -- RBC Capital Markets -- AnalystPerfect. And then the next question is more about capital allocation. Like, obviously, you will need to start the hydro sales process shortly, if you haven't already started. But like with the proceeds, can you just talk about capital allocation in terms of debt reduction, share buybacks, and I guess it's utility growth sometime, whether that's next year or the year after?Darren Myers -- Chief Financial OfficerYeah, Nelson. I mean, really, for us, it's around getting that strong balance sheet, you know, rightsizing the dividend. You know, primarily, this is all going to debt repayment. And of course, you know, with that strong balance sheet, we will have some flexibility to make different choices from there, but the primary focus is really to be more self-sustaining, you know, earn on what we have today and just be in a position of strength. Chris Huskilson -- Chief Executive OfficerYeah. And I'd say, Nelson, we're not ruling out buybacks, but at the end of the day, it's flexibility that we want and strength in our balance sheet. Those are the two things that are primarily on our minds. And so, you know, at the end of the day, we'll make those decisions as time unfolds. Nelson Ng -- RBC Capital Markets -- AnalystOK. So, primarily, debt repayment but not ruling out buybacks?Chris Huskilson -- Chief Executive OfficerCorrect. Darren Myers -- Chief Financial OfficerThat's right. Nelson Ng -- RBC Capital Markets -- AnalystOK. Thank you. I'll leave it there and get back in the queue. Chris Huskilson -- Chief Executive OfficerOK. Thank you. OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Jarvi from CIBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Mark Jarvi -- AnalystHey. Good morning, everyone. Can I --Chris Huskilson -- Chief Executive OfficerGood morning, Mark. Mark Jarvi -- AnalystCan you give us a bit more -- yeah -- yeah, a lot to unpack here, very busy. Congrats on the deal. Can you explain the sort of change in tone around utility spend? Originally, it was that if the balance sheet was in a better position, you got the proceeds, you could accelerate spend. It's kind of going the opposite way here. I get the issues of regulatory lag, but just trying to understand what's kind of transpired over the last few months here or quarter that really does have you really cutting back. Is it just more challenging regulatory environment, the push-out in some of the rate cases? It does seem a bit of a departure from what you guys were signaling before. Chris Huskilson -- Chief Executive OfficerYeah. Well, so we still see that future as has been described as our future. But at the end of the day, we also believe we need to put a substantial amount of discipline into this business. And so, as we work through, you know, accountability and how we want to structure and run our utilities, at the end of the day, you know, the main word is discipline. And so, you know, we want to be absolutely certain that we understand, when we put a dollar of capital in the business, how we're going to recover that dollar of capital and how we're going to -- how that's going to advance our relationship with our customers, our service to our customers, and ultimately, the value for our shareholders. And so, that's really what we're working as we speak. And as I said, you know, one of my three goals originally was to get the business up and running -- the regulated business up and running as a normal regulated utility. And I've said to people all along for the past year that this utility was cobbled together. It wasn't running the way I would have expected it to run. And as we, you know, learn more about how it runs and the discipline that it needs in order to be a good solid investment for folks, that's really what we've come to. And that opportunity to do capital-light growth is one that is pretty unique, and we're happy to be able to take advantage of that. Darren Myers -- Chief Financial OfficerAnd, Mark, maybe just -- the only thing I'd just add to that is nothing has changed from our view that we originally came out with, which is the ability to invest $1 billion a year in this business. But I would say, you know, I don't know if it's a change in tone because we've been very consistent, we need to get more discipline in the business. And if we don't have that right discipline, we can't go spend the capital. We need to be good stewards of the capital and do good things for our customers and for our shareholders. So, you're seeing us -- you know, we're not -- we -- we're -- we need to be better on our returns. And once we are there, we will spend more capital. Chris Huskilson -- Chief Executive OfficerYeah. Mark Jarvi -- AnalystUnderstood. And then, Darren, coming back to the question of where does the proceeds go, it doesn't seem like it's buyback. You did mention that the APCo bonds was a break fee. So, I assume those get repaid, as well as, obviously, the construction financing. If you think about then the residual proceeds, what you expect to get from Atlantica, you might be at a point where you don't have to pay more, you know, floating rate debt or variable rate debt and you got your credit metrics. Will you sit on a cash balance for a while? Is that the expectation here as you work through the repositioning of the utility franchise?Darren Myers -- Chief Financial OfficerYeah. I think we'll continue to look at what the most optimal capital structures after. I think there's lots of options to repay debt but have the ability to, you know, obviously flex up credit facilities up and down. So, we'll give more of that. And we do plan, you know, as we've said before, when we get closer to the closure of the renewables business to provide an Investor Day update to give you, you know, lots of the questions that I know you -- that you have. Chris Huskilson -- Chief Executive OfficerYeah. And, you know, just remember, a fair bit of time will pass before this cash actually comes to us. So, that -- you know, that's another factor in this. It's going to take some time to get through the regulatory approvals and so on that we need for these investments or these transactions, including AY. You know, we're not sure exactly when that will get approved either. Mark Jarvi -- AnalystRight. And then just, Darren, as a follow-up, improved disclosure, sharing some views pro forma utility business after the close of the sale. I know you're trying to infer to us where the earnings is going to be with the payout ratio, but is there something where you could actually show the trajectory as you go into '25, '26, '27? Is that something where you think you could be a bit more explicit on the earnings outlook on an annual basis, whether that's guidance on a multiyear basis or just the cadence of the EPS, you know, uplift over time?Darren Myers -- Chief Financial OfficerYeah, no, absolutely, we will. Like I said, at an Investor Day, we'll give you, you know, as much transparency as we can so that you understand what we're doing and what you should be holding us accountable to. We're not prepared to do that today, but we definitely will. As we get closer to the closure of the deal, we'll give you more. Chris Huskilson -- Chief Executive OfficerYeah. And as we get into some of these regulatory processes, we'll have a better idea as to when these things might close, so, you know, that'll be the biggest factor is when do we actually see the proceeds. Mark Jarvi -- AnalystUnderstood. Thanks for the time today. Appreciate it. Chris Huskilson -- Chief Executive OfficerYeah. Darren Myers -- Chief Financial OfficerThanks, Mark. Chris Huskilson -- Chief Executive OfficerThank you. OperatorThank you. There are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call over to Mr. Chris Huskilson. Chris Huskilson -- Chief Executive OfficerOK. Well, with that, we'd like to thank everyone for their interest in Algonquin. And also, again, I want to thank the team from across the entire business that actually pulled this together, the folks in the renewables side and the folks across the business. This was a tremendous effort and obviously very successful. So, thank you all for that, and thank you for your time today.

      "A U. S. federal judge has ruled that Google, owned by Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL), has violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act, indicating that the company has unfairly acted to maintain a monopoly. The heart of the government's antitrust case centered on exclusive deals the company struck with smartphone makers such as Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Samsung to be the default search engine of their mobile devices. These deals have become quite large over the years. For example, Google has a reported $8 billion, four-year deal with Samsung, while a revenue-sharing deal with Apple is believed to be worth over $20 billion a year. In 2021, Alphabet paid over $26 billion to provide the default search engine on various smartphones and web browsers. The questions for investors are: What is happening now, and how will this impact Alphabet stock in the future?Alphabet undoubtedly will appeal the ruling, while a separate ruling to determine penalties will also need to take place. This will take some time to play out. First and foremost, the ruling could mean the end of exclusive search deals where Google will automatically become the default search browser for mobile devices. Instead, users could be given a choice of which search engine to use when they set up their mobile devices. There has been talk of simply adding a \"choice screen\" to the device's initial setup process, allowing users to switch their default engines from Google to another search engine. In the most severe case, the company could be broken up, but that seems unlikely. Ironically, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) was a primary witness in the case, although it certainly had deep-enough pockets to try and strike its own exclusive search deals. Microsoft, meanwhile, was found guilty of its own antitrust practices back in 2000. The government case against this company largely stemmed from bundling its Windows operating system with the Internet Explorer browser. Around the time of the Microsoft verdict, a quarterly magazine from the Teach Democracy foundation wrote: \"Microsoft now faces legal consequences as well as rapidly evolving technologies. Both may challenge its domination of the computer software industry. \"The same thing could be written about Google today, especially with the advent of artificial intelligence (AI). Notably, 24 years later, the impact on Microsoft from both the court decision and evolving technologies appears to have been negligible in terms of its dominance in operating systems and worker-productivity tools. The same could very well hold true for Google. While Google benefits from these deals, its name is synonymous with search at this point. Given the choice, it's highly unlikely a meaningful number of users will switch to a different default search engine. Now in his ruling, Judge Amit Mehta wrote:Google, of course, recognizes that losing defaults would dramatically impact its bottom line. For instance, Google has projected that losing the Safari default would result in a significant drop in queries and billions of dollars in lost revenues. However, this loss in revenue would likely come from Google being replaced as a default search engine, not as one of several options from which users can choose. In this case, any deals with mobile companies and browsers will now likely be for much less money, while there is a strong chance its market share is barely impacted, much like how Windows' market share wasn't affected by the 2000 ruling. Given the court ruling, there is certainly a lot of uncertainty hanging over Alphabet, and one thing the market doesn't like is uncertainty. However, the long-lasting impact of the ruling on the company is likely to be quite minor. Google did not become the dominant search engine because of these deals; it was already the leader even before the advent of smartphones. Bing is unlikely to suddenly gain a lot of market share, while AI-powered upstarts are burning through cash and need to be able to gain share and monetize their users while being sub-scale. Apple could build or buy its own search engine, but its closed-wall ecosystem is already facing much scrutiny. As such, I feel that much like Microsoft Windows has remained the king of PC operating systems, Google will continue to be the dominant player in search. At the same time, the company's Q2 results have started to show the positive impact AI can have on its search business. AI provides an opportunity for the company to monetize a lot of search queries that it previously was not monetizing, as it only displays ads on about 20% of its searches. It is now just beginning to show new types of ads associated with queries that pull up AI-generated answers. Trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just over 18 times 2025 analyst estimates, Alphabet's stock is attractively priced, given its growth and the opportunities in front of it.

      "The \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks -- Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Tesla -- have notably outperformed the stock market over the last five years. For example, the median performer out of the group, Microsoft, has a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 26% during this period. That's nearly double the return generated by the S&P 500 (15%). But investing means looking forward, not backward, and it's always important to ask what would drive a highflying stock even higher. So, which of these stocks could help set investors up for life? Here are the two I have my eye on right now. The first Magnificent Seven stock that can help set investors up for life is Meta Platforms. Meta, which operates social networks including Facebook and Instagram, has more than 3. 3 billion monthly active users (MAUs). That's equal to roughly 40% of the total world population. With so many people accessing its platforms, it's no wonder that the company makes billions off ad placement on its networks. In this year's second quarter, Meta reported $39 billion in revenue, and almost all of it -- some 98% -- came from ad sales. Yet, despite its massive size and singular focus on digital advertising, it remains an unstoppable growth engine. The company grew its total revenue 22% year over year in its most recent quarter, which is outstanding for such a large business. Indeed, it has averaged an incredible 32% quarterly revenue growth dating back to 2014. What's more, Meta isn't just growing its top-line numbers. Take free cash flow (FCF) per share, a crucial financial metric that shows how much cash a company is generating on a per share basis. Meta's free cash flow per share has been steadily rising. The company now generates $18. 82 per share in FCF, up from $6. 60 less than two years ago. That's crucial for investors because FCF per share measures how much money a business is generating, which can then be spent on dividend payments, share buybacks, debt reduction, and other purposes. In other words, it gives a company's leadership the ability to deliver value to shareholders. Thanks to its immense scale and fat profit margins, Meta's business model is likely to continue delivering shareholder value for many years to come. That makes it a stock that could help set investors up for life. Similar to Meta Platforms, Alphabet is a major player in the digital advertising market. Through its Google Search and YouTube segments, the company generates hundreds of billions in ad-based revenue. In the second quarter, Alphabet recorded $85 billion in total revenue. That's nearly $1 billion per day. And $65 billion, or 76%, of this total came from advertising on Google Search, Google Network, and YouTube. What's truly impressive is how efficient Alphabet is at turning its revenue into profits. The company's operating margin is 32%, the highest in more than a decade and well above its 10-year average of 26%. High profitability is key for any stock. It indicates that a company is managing its operations well and is producing profits that can then be used to deliver shareholder value or grow its business. Granted, Alphabet has its challenges, including a recent federal antitrust ruling that is working its way through the courts and the general market volatility that has skyrocketed in recent weeks. But long-term investors should remember that uncertain times are in many ways the best times to invest. Warren Buffett famously said that to the extent investors should follow their emotions, it's better to be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful. Given Alphabet's excellent business model and solid operating margin, smart investors should be giving the internet giant a serious look.

      "There are plenty of things for an executive to worry about, but Jeff Green probably has one of the best gigs in town. \"I'm way more concerned about the tidal wave of opportunity being too big and us not being equipped to handle all of the opportunity that comes to us than I am that the wave doesn't exist or it's too small,\" Green, the CEO, and co-founder of The Trade Desk  (TTD) , said during the company's recent earnings call. Related: Analyst revises Trade Desk stock price target ahead of earningsGreen's enthusiasm was undoubtedly related to the company's second-quarter results, which beat Wall Street's expectations. \"Our growth rate significantly outpaced the rest of the digital marketing industry just as it has every quarter for the last few years,\" he told analysts. The Trade Desk, a programmatic marketing company, enables buying media inventory across various channels, including display, video, audio, and connected TV, most commonly used to stream video. Green noted that the total addressable global digital advertising market has the potential to reach $1 trillion and added that the Trade Desk is positioned well to capture more than its fair share of that $1 trillion. Greg Doherty/Getty Images\"I'm convinced that our success has been forged on the back of consistent strong 20%-plus revenue growth year after year for the past several years,\" he told analysts. \"By comparison, our ad-funded peers have gone through periods of much lower growth and even stagnation in some cases. \"\"That means we are consistently gaining market share quarter after quarter and year after year,\" Green added. \"And I firmly believe that's because we continue to bring the best innovation and best value to the market. \"Related: Analyst reboots Trade Desk stock price target after Netflix dealHe also discussed Kokai, the AI-based media buying platform that the company launched last year. \"Kokai allows our clients to deploy data about their most loyal customers and then use that data as a seed to grow and harvest the next generation of loyal customers,\" he said. \"Kokai helps them target those new audiences across the many thousands of destinations that comprise the best of the open Internet. \"\"And it leverages AI to help them make sense of the roughly 15 million ad opportunities we see every second and the hundreds of variables associated with each one of them,\" Green added. Green discussed Alphabet's  (GOOGL)  current legal headaches during the question and answer period. Judge Amit Mehta of the US District Court of the District of Columbia decided on Aug. 5 that Alphabet, Inc. ’s Google illegally monopolized the search engine market through exclusive deals with Apple,  (AAPL) , and others. Related: Analysts review Apple stock price hit from Google antitrust rulingGoogle is also facing an antitrust trial next month in the Eastern District of Virginia over anticompetitive conduct in advertising technology, which Bloomberg Law said \"could be a seismic event—potentially determining whether Google remains a single entity or is fragmented into separate companies. \"\"They are a weaker competitor than they've been for us in years past,\" Green said. \"And as I've often said, we've been winning in an unfair market. Imagine what we could do if we're competing in a fair market. \"\"I think as a result of that, I believe we'll win no matter what the outcomes of this case are, but it will still be fun to watch,\" he noted. The Trade Desk posted second-quarter earnings of 39 cents per share, up from 28 cents a year ago and beating the consensus estimate of 36 cents per share. Revenue totaled $584. 6 million, up from $464 million a year ago, and coming in ahead of Wall Street’s call for $578. 1 million in sales. Looking ahead, the company guided to third-quarter revenue of $618 million, above estimates of $605. 5 million. More Tech Stocks:Sony’s Bungie criticized for layoffs after CEO spends millionsNvidia stock tumbles in tech slump amid questions over key chipAnalysts adjust Palantir stock price target ahead of earningsTheStreet Pro’s Chris Versace liked those numbers and raised his price target on The Trade Desk shares to $120 from $110. \"Trade Desk continues to benefit from the overall mix shift toward digital advertising as advertisers look to reach consumer eyeballs,\" he wrote in his Aug. 9 column. \"It is also benefiting from the growing use of advertising business models across streaming video platforms and digital audio like those found at Netflix  (NFLX) , Disney  (DIS) , Warner Bros. Discovery  (WBD) , Amazon  (AMZN) , Spotify  (SPOT)  and others,\" Versace added. Several analysts adjusted their price targets following The Trade Desk's earnings report. RBC Capital raised the firm's price target on the company to $120 from $110 and kept an outperform rating on the shares. The Trade Desk delivered a strong quarter in what has been a mixed macro, delivering upside to revenue and strong profitability, the firm said. The company's raised third-quarter guidance also stands out from peers as The Trade Desk continues to benefit from several cyclical and secular drivers, including market share gains from walled gardens but most notably within CTV, the firm added. Truist boosted the firm's price target on Trade Desk to $108 from $105 and maintained a buy rating on the shares, citing the company’s earnings beat and the “stronger” third-quarter guide. Trade Desk's execution remains exceptional amid a volatile digital ad environment, with strong momentum and market share gains driven by connected TV business given its rapid adoption in the U. S. and internationally, the firm said. KeyBanc analyst Justin Patterson raised the firm's price target on Trade Desk to $115 from $105 and kept an overweight rating on the shares. The Trade Desk is clearly gaining share in the ad market, with benefits from the Kokai innovation and the Netflix partnership still to come, the analyst said. Patterson said that he thinks more than 20% year-over-year revenue growth is achievable in 2025 and 2026, with the optionality of faster growth around regulatory decisions.

      "Well, it's official: Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), the parent company of Google, has lost a landmark antitrust lawsuit in Federal court. On Aug. 5, Judge Amit Mehta ruled that Alphabet has illegally stifled competition in the online search market. In his 277-page ruling, Mehta concluded, \"Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly. \"So, what does this all mean for Alphabet and its stock? In this article, three Motley Fool contributors discuss Alphabet's prospects and how investors should react. Jake Lerch: In a nutshell, there are two key takeaways from the recent antitrust ruling:This ruling is a problem for Alphabet. However, it's far from catastrophic. First, let's examine why it's a problem. It should come as no surprise that losing the case is a negative outcome for the company. After all, at the very least, Alphabet will have to spend more time and money appealing the ruling (which the company has already announced it will do). That process will likely drag out for several more years. However, if Alphabet's appeals fail, the company will be forced to settle the lawsuit or accept the judge's yet-to-be-revealed remedies. Neither of those options is favorable, as they could mean paying tens of billions of dollars in fines and legal settlements. In addition, the government could seek changes to Alphabet's business practices. Specifically, the government now finds itself in a powerful position to demand alterations to Google Search -- which is the company's most lucrative business segment. All in all, this ruling introduces significant uncertainty to Alphabet and its stock. Yet there are silver linings. For one thing, the ruling focuses on Alphabet's practice of paying other companies to make Google Search their default search engine. Apple, for example, received over $18 billion in 2021 in exchange for making Google the default search engine across its products. Alphabet also has deals with Samsung and numerous other device makers, and Mozilla, the nonprofit project behind Firefox. Those agreements are now on the chopping block, which, in a strange twist of fate, may temporarily boost Alphabet's profits. Since the company won't be paying device makers like Apple to make its search engine the default, it should save billions of dollars per year. What's unclear is whether Google will lose significant search-engine market share in response, which would hurt profitability. In any event, there's no reason to believe that Google's search dominance will end quickly. As noted earlier, the appeals process will likely drag out for several years. In the meantime, Alphabet will continue to rack up billions in revenue and profits. So, while this ruling highlights why Alphabet isn't a stock for every investor, I remain bullish on it. Justin Pope: Alphabet's loss in the antitrust lawsuit shouldn't be a shock -- Google has over 90% market share of internet search worldwide. Ultimately, the company's anticompetitive tactics, including paying Apple nearly $20 billion annually to make Google the default search engine on iOS devices, were its undoing. So where does this go from here?Of course Alphabet will appeal, and the court will work to determine penalties ranging from fines to mandates. For example, the company could be forced to divest its Android business. Virtually every non-Apple smartphone -- about 70% of the world's phones -- uses Android software. Owning Android makes it easy for Alphabet to steer most of the world's smartphones to Google. This can all seem scary to investors because Google, which makes money through digital ads, is Alphabet's golden goose. But note a couple of things. First, this process will take time, perhaps multiple years, to finish playing out. There's no reason to panic-sell Alphabet stock. Second, Google probably deserves some benefit of the doubt. Most people who grew up with the internet have never used any search engine besides Google. After all, people don't search for things; they \"Google\" them. That's some serious brand power. Alphabet has also built an ecosystem around Google, including its popular web browser Chrome, and software like Gmail. The company has aggressively pushed artificial intelligence (AI) features into Google and has massive amounts of user data from years of dominating search. Knocking Google off won't be easy, even if mandates encourage others to try. So, while Alphabet's antitrust loss is noteworthy, let's pump the brakes and see how things play out. Until proven otherwise, Alphabet is one of the world's most dominant companies. Will Healy: Investors may not know what to make of the judgment that Alphabet's Google search engine is a monopoly. The company paid other companies like Apple and Samsung to make it the default search engine on their platforms. Although the government ruled such payments illegal, users don't pay Alphabet directly for using Google Search, leaving some wondering whether the ruling is relevant to the average consumer. Pending the likely appeals and possible punishments, Alphabet's short-term and medium-term prospects have become less clear. This may lead shareholders to sell, or at least not add shares. However, such news may actually be an argument for buying shares slowly; here's why. First, Google is widely perceived as the best search engine. Hence, even if it can no longer pay companies to be the default search engine, investors shouldn't assume that it will lose all or even most of its market share. That share currently stands at 91%, according to StatCounter. Secondly, Alphabet has slowly moved away from relying on revenue from advertising, most of which is driven by Google Search. Advertising has fallen from 87% of revenue in 2017 to 78% in 2023. So, while the judgment could speed the transition away from advertising, relying less on search was the company's plan anyway. Finally, Alphabet's efforts to move outside of search are technically advanced and well-funded. The company has utilized artificial intelligence in some form since 2001. And Google Cloud, its largest non-advertising segment, is the world's third-largest cloud infrastructure provider:Image source: Statista. Additionally, Alphabet holds $101 billion in liquidity. This means it can spend, and likely has spent, heavily on building these alternative businesses. Indeed, the hardest part for shareholders is waiting through the appeal, to see how any punishment could affect the company should Alphabet lose again. However, between the continued popularity of Google Search and a well-funded move away from its ad business, investors should probably consider adding shares on any significant pullback.

      "Surprising news has just come out of Omaha, Nebraska. Warren Buffett sold half of Berkshire Hathaway's monster stake in Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), adding tens of billions of dollars to the company's cash heap. At the end of last quarter, Berkshire Hathaway had $277 billion in cash and equivalents, giving it one of -- if not the -- world's largest cash reserves for an individual company. Berkshire's Apple investment was worth $84 billion at the end of the second quarter, down from $150 billion a few years ago. What is Buffett planning to do with Berkshire's cash? Why has he soured on Apple? And should you do the same for your portfolio? Let's take a closer look and find out. Apple reported earnings on Aug. 1 for the second calendar quarter of 2024. Its results have looked similar for the last few quarters. Hardware revenue has stagnated, with iPhone, iPad, and Wearables revenue all down in the first nine months of this Apple fiscal year versus the prior year. The only bright spot was the Mac, but that was a slight increase in sales. On a positive note, Apple services' revenue continues to climb. Revenue for the segment hit $71 billion over the last nine months, up from $63 billion in the same period a year prior. Services are a higher-margin business for Apple that comes from App Store fees, advertisements, Apple TV, and other software programs that it sells to customers. This has been the story for Apple for a long time. Even though Apple is not growing hardware sales, these new software products will drive growth for the company. Looking holistically, Apple's sales have not gone anywhere for a while. After the COVID-19 pandemic boost, revenue has been flat over trailing 12-month periods for a few years. In fact, revenue is still down from its peak at the end of 2022. One key reason for this is China. The region is important for Apple and has a weak consumer economy right now. Revenue in the first nine months of this fiscal year was $52 billion in China compared to $57. 5 billion a year ago. Apple's services business looks like all sunshine and rainbows, driving margins higher and higher. However, a good chunk of Apple's services revenue is simply a distribution payment from Google Search to be the default search engine on Safari. Apple reportedly receives over $20 billion a year from Alphabet for this distribution agreement, which comes at close to 100% profit margins. Analysts estimate that this payment may make up 15% of Apple's consolidated earnings power. Now, there is the risk this payment deal will come apart. A judge just ruled that Google Search's default distribution agreements are monopolistic, siding in the U. S. government in its case vs. Alphabet. This could be bad news for Alphabet, but it is even worse news for Apple. If it loses this lucrative distribution deal, Apple will see an estimated 15% of its profits evaporate overnight. And that is alongside stagnating top-line growth. The one gem of its business -- services -- could turn into a dud within a few years if the courts rule against Apple. AAPL PE Ratio data by YChartsEven though Apple's revenue is stagnating and its high-profit Google distribution payment is at risk of imploding, the stock was at an all-time high at the end of the second quarter. It is no surprise, then, to see Buffett selling some of his position. Today, the stock is a tad lower due to the broad market downturn. However, it still trades at an expensive-looking price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 31. 5. That is much higher than the S&P 500 average for a company with stagnating sales. Buffett likes to buy businesses closer to a P/E of 10, which is when he started buying Apple shares eight years ago. He clearly still likes the business -- it is Berkshire Hathaway's largest equity holding -- but the stock is very expensive at these prices. A low-growth stock with uncertainty around a large chunk of its profits and cash flow (the Google antitrust case) does not deserve to trade at over 30x earnings. Even Apple. Buffett understands this, which is why he is trimming his position. He would rather sit in short-term U. S. treasury bills that pay him a guaranteed 5% interest rate every year. If you hold Apple, this doesn't mean you should immediately sell your position. But if it is an outsize position in your portfolio like it was at Berkshire Hathaway, it might be smart to diversify your holdings along with Buffett.

      "Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) built its massive business around providing users with useful search results. Its search engine is so critical for businesses to succeed that companies often hire experts on search engine optimization to ensure they rank high on search results. Being in the top position can make a significant difference in how much traffic and revenue a business generates. Chatbots and artificial intelligence (AI) can throw a serious wrench into that. If, for instance, users only need to ask a personal assistant or chatbot a question, rather than use Google Search, it can impact how much traffic is going to the popular search engine. Tech companies have been investing in developing their own chatbots, with arguably none more popular than OpenAI's ChatGPT. And OpenAI recently announced plans to launch another product, and this one is a more direct threat to Google Search. It's an actual search engine called SearchGPT. In July, OpenAI announced that it's testing SearchGPT, which uses AI to help people find what they're looking for, similar to its chatbot ChatGPT. The key difference is that, unlike the chatbot, where users get a single result, they can get multiple results and links to sources. The company says that SearchGPT will \"combine the strength of our AI models with information from the web to give you fast and timely answers with clear and relevant sources. \" It's currently in testing mode and there's a wait list for people to try the prototype, so there's no timeline as to when it may be fully available to the public. Google faced competition from many search engines in the past, but there's definitely something different about SearchGPT. ChatGPT has proven to be immensely popular, already having more than 200 million monthly users. And that popularity could help SearchGPT be a potentially formidable competitor to Google Search. Compounding the issue for Google is a recent ruling in the courts that found that Alphabet has an illegal monopoly when it comes to its search engine. Alphabet has been paying companies billions of dollars to become the default search engine on phones and browsers. The court ruled that by doing so, the company effectively stifled competition. It's not clear what the penalties or consequences will be, but the ruling could significantly impact Google Search's practices. This could exacerbate the challenge the company may face from SearchGPT in the near future. It's hard to overstate the importance of these developments. Of the nearly $85 billion in revenue that Alphabet generated in its most recent quarter, which ended in June, approximately $49 billion was from revenue related to its \"Google Search & Other\" segment. When including Google Network and YouTube ads, all Google advertising revenue for the period totaled $64. 6 billion. Alphabet has a lot at stake if it loses its dominant position in search. It generates a considerable amount of money from ads related to Google Search. If the recent ruling changes how its business operates, it may be easier for a competitor, such as SearchGPT, to put a big dent into the web traffic that goes to Google Search and, ultimately, the revenue Alphabet generates from that. Investors shouldn't dismiss the threat that SearchGPT and AI, in general, pose to Alphabet's business. The company could potentially have the most to lose due to AI since it's so dependent on search queries and questions people enter into its search engine. Alphabet has been working on developing its own chatbot Gemini, and its success could ultimately determine how effectively Alphabet can fend off this latest threat. But it's too early to tell at this point what the impact will be from SearchGPT. The danger for Alphabet is that with so much exposure to search-related revenue, a drop in that could significantly impact its valuation, which is currently around $2 trillion. Before I'd consider investing in Alphabet's business, I'd wait to see not only how effective and popular SearchGPT is, but also what impact the recent antitrust ruling has on Google Search. Until there's clarity on those two issues, the prudent thing for investors to do may be to wait on the sidelines for now. Investing in the tech stock with those two issues still up in the air could leave investors exposed to too much risk and uncertainty.

      "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a scorching-hot buy over the past couple of years, largely due to the key role it plays in artificial intelligence (AI). The company's AI chips are crucial for companies that are developing AI models. And Nvidia has a commanding 80% market share when it comes to AI chips. That's part of the reason why investors have remained bullish on the stock -- it's arguably the best-positioned stock to benefit from growing demand for AI. But given how lucrative the opportunities are in AI, it's only a matter of time before more competitors emerge and fight for market share. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has recently turned to one of those unexpected competitors to source chips for its new AI-powered iPhones. One of the companies that has been developing its own chips is Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL). And Apple has been training its new AI system, called \"Apple Intelligence,\" using Alphabet's custom chips, according to a research paper. The company used two versions of Google's tensor processing unit to develop its AI models, which gives iPhone users access to generative AI features, including advanced writing tools, the ability to generate images, and a Siri assistant with \"all-new superpowers. \"Alphabet is a potentially strong competitor for Nvidia to worry about. The company has plenty of resources to work with. Last year, Alphabet generated more than $69 billion in free cash flow. It has been investing in its AI chatbot Gemini, and AI chips could provide it with yet another growth opportunity to pile money into. The courts recently found that the company's search engine, Google, has an illegal monopoly. And depending on what the consequences of that finding are, Alphabet may soon see a huge incentive to find a new growth opportunity to pursue, as the ruling may have a detrimental effect on a key part of its business. Beyond Alphabet, however, there are other competitors for Nvidia to worry about. Meta Platforms has been working on an AI chip of its own, as has Amazon. And investors also shouldn't forget about AMD, which is a more traditional rival for Nvidia. Although it has been late to the game, AMD has made it clear that AI is a big priority for the business, and it could also take away some sizable market share from Nvidia in the future. Nvidia has generated incredible gains due to its dominance in the AI chip space. And it is working on innovating and coming out with more advanced chips to ensure it remains on top. But maintaining such a large market share can be incredibly difficult, especially with so many big tech companies out there with deep pockets to contend with. They aren't simply going to ignore such a massive opportunity in AI chips. The company's revenue has taken off over the past year, with Nvidia's growth rate in recent quarters being well in excess of 200%. Those kinds of numbers, while extremely impressive, are also extremely difficult to maintain. At some point, Nvidia's growth rate will start to come down, especially if more competition emerges in the field. And its high-priced chips may also need to come down in price if that's the case, which may lead to both a slowing growth rate and smaller profit margins than the 50%-plus margins it has been averaging of late. Nvidia's stock has been giving back some gains in recent weeks, but it's still a top company to invest in if you want exposure to the red-hot AI market. While other companies may try to take market share from Nvidia, that doesn't mean that they will be able to do so overnight. Nvidia is still in an excellent position to continue growing, but I would expect its growth rate and margins to come down a bit in future quarters, especially as companies potentially reduce AI spending due to a possible economic slowdown. Nvidia's stock may struggle in the near term, but as long you're willing to hang on for the long term, it can still make for a good buy. Still, you should brace for some challenges ahead.

      "Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC) stock has been battered and beaten this month, and August has only just begun. The company's share price has plunged 34% since July 30 amid a sell-off affecting countless stocks. Growing fears of a recession and dismal earnings from Intel sent investors into a panic. While I firmly believe in holding through a market dip rather than selling a tech stock like Intel, it doesn't necessarily mean now is the time to buy more. The above chart shows that despite recent declines, Intel's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is significantly higher than other tech stocks. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) offer similar exposure to budding markets like artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing yet are trading at a better value than Intel. In addition to Intel's stock being poorly valued, its latest quarter (the second quarter of 2024) missed revenue and earnings-per-share (EPS) expectations. Meanwhile, recent earnings from AMD and Alphabet illustrate a positive growth trajectory. So forget Intel and consider buying these two millionaire-maker stocks instead. AMD's stock has tumbled 24% over the last month as tech stocks have fallen out of favor. However, the company boasts a long history of growth that has seen it create many millionaires, with its share price up more than 3,000% since 2014. The company has enjoyed immense success over the years, taking on a crucial role in the chip market. AMD's hardware powers products across tech, from game consoles like Sony's PlayStation 5 to consumer-built PCs, laptops, data centers, and AI models. As a result, AMD is easily one of the best stocks to gain exposure to different areas of tech. AMD's closest competitors are Nvidia and Intel, and the three companies are fierce rivals in AI chips. Nvidia dominates the industry, while Intel has yet to make real headway. However, recent earnings indicate AMD's AI division is on a promising growth path and gaining on Nvidia. In Q2 2024, AMD's revenue rose 9% year over year, beating expectations by $120 million. Meanwhile, earnings per share of $0. 69 outperformed estimates by $0. 01. The quarter benefited from a 115% year-over-year revenue increase in its AI-focused data center segment and a 49% rise in client sales. AMD's gaming segment suffered from reductions in semi-custom chip sales, with revenue falling 59%. However, that didn't stop solid growth in the quarter as the company pivoted its business toward AI. Operating income for the period hit $269 million, significantly improving on the $20 million in losses reported a year ago. AMD's Q2 2024 proves it's enjoying impressive returns on its hefty investment in AI and gaining in the industry. Its quarterly free cash flow has soared 81% year to date, increasing its spending power. In addition to being a better-valued stock, AMD is a no-brainer buy over Intel right now. Alphabet's share price has tumbled 17% since early July, in tandem with the tech sell-off. However, its forward P/E of 21 makes it one of the best-valued stocks in tech and too good to pass up. Meanwhile, like AMD, recent earnings hint at a lucrative future for the tech giant. The Google company reported its Q2 2024 earnings at the end of July, with revenue rising 14% year over year to $85 billion. The quarter saw solid growth in advertising, with sales increasing by 11%. However, Google Cloud delivered the most gains, with revenue soaring 28% year over year and beating competitors Amazon Web Services and Microsoft in cloud growth for the period. At the start of the year, Alphabet seemed to fall behind its cloud rivals, but earnings prove it's quickly catching up. In addition to impressive revenue growth, Google Cloud's operating income nearly tripled and hit more than $1 billion for the first time. Success in cloud computing is promising for Alphabet as it diversifies its earnings, allowing it to lean less on advertising and secure a promising role in AI. Alphabet has a long history of making people rich and undoubtedly created more than a few millionaires, with its stock up 470% over the last decade. With its bargain price, Alphabet's stock is worth picking up over Intel and is an excellent way to invest in tech.

      "This week's stock market movement features a lot of fear. Tech stocks sold off heavily, while safe-haven stocks like utilities and pharmaceuticals saw increased interest. The Nasdaq entered correction territory, falling more than 10% off its recent highs. A relatively weak jobs report (114,000 created vs. 185,000 estimates) has some thinking about a recession again and selling stocks. Many investors get understandably jittery during these events. However, market pullbacks are entirely normal. I look forward to these opportunities. Finally, investors can purchase stocks at reasonable prices rather than at all-time highs. Even the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks are not immune to a correction. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is trading 20% below its recent high, as shown below. The downturn looks like an excellent opportunity for investors to pick up shares at a great price. Here's why. The market wasn't pleased with Amazon's second-quarter earnings, but I think some are having trouble seeing the forest for the trees. Net sales increased 10% to $148 billion in Q2, a slowdown from the 13% growth in Q1. This should not be a surprise, given the economy-wide slowing of consumer spending. Amazon's operating income jumped 91%, from $7. 7 billion in Q2 last year to $14. 7 billion this year. While this looks terrific compared to 2023, it is 4% less sequentially. The slight slowdown in growth from Q1 to Q2 and new recession fears are worrying Wall Street. But Amazon's results were stellar where it matters most: AWS. AWS is Amazon's cash cow. The cloud segment accounted for $66 billion in operating profits for 2021-2023 combined, a whopping 89% of the company's total operating profit. This is despite a rough 2023 when companies cut data budgets in anticipation of a recession that never came. But artificial intelligence (AI) is now a massive tailwind for cloud service providers. Generative AI programs require incredible data and processing power, and AWS will be a major beneficiary. As shown below, AWS revenue growth accelerated in each of the last three quarters. This trend is encouraging and bodes well for Amazon's results and stock over the long haul. When valuing Amazon, I like to look at its price-to-sales (P/S) ratio and its price-to-cash from operations (CFO). Cash from operations, often called operating cash flow, is important because it tells us how much money a company's primary business generates. As depicted below, Amazon is undervalued by 13% based on sales and 75% based on cash flow compared to its 10-year averages. This is the lowest it has traded based on cash flow in over 10 years. Valuing Amazon requires looking past a simple price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, but the current P/E ratio of 38 is also the lowest in more than 10 years. Amazon's overall sales growth could continue hovering near 10%. Management guided for 8% to 11% growth next quarter. However, AWS is the profit center; it has AI tailwinds and accelerating growth. At times like these, I like to remember two things that Warren Buffett says: \"Be greedy when others are fearful\" and \"the stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient. \" This advice could work well for Amazon investors.

      "The last 12 months have been volatile for Shopify's (NYSE: SHOP) investors. At one point, the stock traded at a low of $45. 50, but it then doubled in the next few months to reach $91. 57. Today, the stock is back down to about $63. The recent stock movement suggests that the bulls and bears are still undecided on Shopify's long-term prospects. The former likes the huge e-commerce opportunity ahead, while the latter has concerns over Shopify's elevated valuation. So what should current and future investors do with Shopify stock? This article aims to shed some light on that. One of the biggest trends in the last two decades is the growth of the e-commerce industry, propelling some of the biggest success stories of our generation. Amazon and Shopify are some examples of the huge beneficiaries of this tailwind. While both companies seem alike to general consumers, they are entirely different companies with vastly different business models. Amazon operates an e-commerce marketplace, selling products directly and indirectly (via third-party merchants) to consumers. This combination of first- and third-party sales models helps Amazon get the best of both worlds, serving its customers and getting commissions from merchants in exchange for sales on its platform. The relationship between Amazon and its merchants is love-hate. On the one hand, merchants depend on Amazon's massive user base and other services like fulfillment and logistics to grow their sales. Yet, they are also at the mercy of the tech giant since Amazon sets the rules of the game, which could go against the interest of its merchants. Worse, Amazon is a direct competitor to these merchants by offering similar products at lower prices -- it can do so because of its huge purchasing power and access to information on historical sales. On the other hand, Shopify is a software-as-a-service (SaaS) company focusing mainly on providing tools to help merchants succeed in the digital world. This means that, unlike Amazon, Shopify allows merchants full ownership over their customer data, brands, websites, and others, giving them control over their business. Besides, merchants can customize their online stores, websites, and services to their business needs, which helps them better serve their customers. This, again, contrasts significantly with Amazon since merchants have no choice but to accept Amazon's decision on store design and other services. Another essential aspect that Shopify brings is to help merchants go omnichannel by providing all the tools to sell online, offline, and everywhere else. For instance, a merchant can begin selling online using the Shopify software platform but later expand in the brick-and-mortar world with the help of Shopify POS, equipped with both hardware and software tools. In short, Shopify has made itself indispensable by aligning its interests with those of its merchants. Shopify has been a remarkable growth stock. From 2015 to 2023, revenue has increased from $205 million to $7. 1 billion . Given its size, some investors have concerns about the tech company's ability to grow from here. I think those concerns, while valid, might have missed the big picture. To start, Shopify enabled $236 billion in gross merchandise value (GMV) in 2023, just 3% of the total U. S. retail market spending of $7. 3 trillion. It could grow exponentially and still not exhaust the opportunity. To this end, the company is heavily investing in growing its offline business via its POS hardware and software offerings, with promising early results. For example, offline revenue reached $411 million in 2023, five times that of 2019 . As long as it can continue to innovate and add tools to help customers become successful in selling offline, it will have plenty of opportunities to grow with existing merchants (those expanding from online to omnichannel) and attract new merchants traditionally from the offline world. But that's not all. Shopify aims to become a global e-commerce player, further expanding its target addressable market. This includes taking its best-in-class tools offered to merchants in existing markets, such as payments, POS, and financing, into newer markets to help overseas merchants become successful. Beyond that, it also allows existing customers to go global via Shopify markets -- a set of tools to help merchants sell internationally. To put it into perspective, global e-commerce sales reached $5. 8 trillion in 2023, not including offline retail. In short, Shopify has enough opportunities to keep it busy for the next decade. Identifying a solid company with good prospects is just half of the equation for a sound investment. Investors should also consider the price they pay for the stock. On that score, Shopify trades at a price-to-sales (PS) ratio of 11. 2, a considerable premium to Amazon's P/S ratio of 3. While it's not unreasonable for investors to pay a higher price tag for Shopify, paying such a huge multiple doesn't seem safe, given its vast prospects. Shopify has delivered a remarkable track record of growth since going public. Better still, the company is well-positioned to keep growing in the coming years as it exploits the opportunities locally and in overseas markets. However, the positive factors have been reflected in its premium valuation, so investors are not getting any bargains when buying the stock today. Overall, while the stock is probably not a good buy today, given the opportunity ahead, it is not a sell for those who already own it. It's a hold for now.

      "What are the early trends we should look for to identify a stock that could multiply in value over the long term? Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. That's why when we briefly looked at Amazon. com's (NASDAQ:AMZN) ROCE trend, we were pretty happy with what we saw. Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Amazon. com:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0. 14 = US$54b ÷ (US$555b - US$158b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2024). Thus, Amazon. com has an ROCE of 14%.  That's a relatively normal return on capital, and it's around the 12% generated by the Multiline Retail industry. Check out our latest analysis for Amazon. com In the above chart we have measured Amazon. com's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Amazon. com  for free. While the returns on capital are good, they haven't moved much. The company has consistently earned 14% for the last five years, and the capital employed within the business has risen 226% in that time. Since 14% is a moderate ROCE though, it's good to see a business can continue to reinvest at these decent rates of return. Over long periods of time, returns like these might not be too exciting, but with consistency they can pay off in terms of share price returns. To sum it up, Amazon. com has simply been reinvesting capital steadily, at those decent rates of return. And since the stock has risen strongly over the last five years, it appears the market might expect this trend to continue. So while the positive underlying trends may be accounted for by investors, we still think this stock is worth looking into further. Amazon. com could be trading at an attractive price in other respects, so you might find our  free intrinsic value estimation for AMZN  on our platform quite valuable.

      "We recently compiled a list of the Warren Buffett and Hedge Funds Are Crazy About These 10 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon. com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other stocks recommended by Warren Buffett and hedge funds. Warren Buffett will go down in history as one of the most successful investors on Wall Street, a feat achieved through integrity, wisdom and wit. He is dubbed the Oracle of Omaha on his investment firm Berkshire Hathaway, delivering a compounded annual gain of 19. 8% since 1958, more than double an increase of 9. 9% for the S&P 500. Berkshire Hathaway stock has gained over 3,787,464% since 1965 compared to a 24,708% gain for the S&P 500, underlining Buffett's stock-picking skills. Buffett is one of the most accomplished investors in the history of Wall Street having amassed a wealth of $138 billion, as reported by Bloomberg's Billionaire Index. His net worth could have been much more had he not made generous contributions to various charitable organizations. In contrast to many other billionaires who prefer lavish lifestyles in large homes and luxury vehicles, Buffett is often seen as one of the most humble billionaires globally. The significant investment gains over the years stem from Buffett buying stocks in various sectors and holding them for years and even decades. Buffett's secret to prosperity mainly lies in investing in well-established, reputable companies with clear competitive edges. Although this approach focuses heavily on undervalued stocks, it also occasionally includes investments in high-growth companies. The investment strategy is often backed by the massive cash haul that Berkshire Hathaway holds on generating earnings per share on most of its investments and through dividend payments. Nevertheless, it is becoming increasingly clear that Warren Buffett and hedge funds are crazy about a particular clique of stocks. High-growth companies and market leaders in respective fields are some of the factors that Buffett and most hedge funds closely watch while selecting stocks.  Technology stocks which consist of some of the biggest companies account for 41% of Buffett's 13F portfolio at the end of March, an edge that has always allowed him to outperform the overall market. Diversification is another important factor in the top stocks that Warren Buffett and hedge funds are crazy about. While technology stocks account for the biggest share, the billionaire investor is also heavily invested in Financials at 21% and Basic Material at 10. 7%. Diversifying aligns with the billionaire investor value investing principles that involve pursuing undervalued investments in various sectors. Over the years, Buffett has always sought securities whose prices are undervalued relative to their intrinsic value. Rather than focusing on short-term gains in the market, the Berkshire Hathaway chief selects stocks based on their long-term potential. It was one of the reasons that Berkshire Hathaway shares ended 2023 with a 15. 8% gain, representing an eighth straight year of advances. Its biggest increase of 29. 6% came in 2021 at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. While Berkshire Hathaway had $189 billion in cash as of the end of the first quarter, the cash haul is expected to surge to $300 billion by the end of the third quarter. While most people might wonder why Buffett is not putting much of the cash to work, the billionaire investor is always cautious focusing on value investments rather than just investing for the sake. The billionaire investor is always driven by the mantra: never invest in overvalued equities. Therefore he always takes time scanning for value investments trading at discounted valuations. Additionally, the sheer size of Berkshire Hathaway means it can only put its money into a select few companies that will significantly impact its returns. This is further compounded by the fact that investments in cash equivalents, such as short-term government bonds, are currently offering returns above 5% which is quite high at current levels. As a result, Warren Buffett and his firm are deliberately seeking the perfect investment at the perfect price, and this opportunity could arise at any moment. In the recent past, Buffett has also gone against the wave amid a shift of focus from oil and gas investment plays amid the transition to clean energy. Buffett remains bullish about investment opportunities in the energy sector amid the carbon care initiatives even as the biggest players continue generating significant returns from the lucrative fossil fuel business. Buffett and hedge funds have also taken keen interest in stocks offering exposure to emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence that are driving valuations higher in the market. In this article, we take a look at some of the top stocks in which Buffett and other hedge funds are heavily invested. Warren Buffett and hedge funds are crazy about these 10 stocks partly because of their growth metrics and long-term prospects. While some of the stocks are trading at a premium valuation, they are market leaders in their respective fields and, therefore, well-positioned to generate long-term value. We have ranked the stocks in Warren Buffett's portfolio based on the number of hedge funds invested and selected the top 10. A customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping. Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 302Amazon. com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is the stock that Warren Buffett and hedge funds are crazy about, owing to its leading position in e-commerce and cloud computing. While Amazon. com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) made a name for itself in selling goods online, it is increasingly becoming a force to reckon with as it continues to leverage artificial intelligence to strengthen its edge on cloud computing. Amazon Web Services, the company's cloud unit, is already designing its chips and is increasingly integrating AI into its offerings to strengthen its competitive edge against Microsoft (MSFT). In addition, Amazon. com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is already eyeing new growth opportunities through its satellite internet subsidiary, Kuiper. As of the end of the first quarter, Warren Buffett and a total of 302 hedge funds held stakes in the tech giant, affirming why it is one of the top stocks. In its investor letter from May 2024, Lakehouse Global Growth Fund provided an update on Amazon. com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), sharing their analysis and perspective on the company's performance and future prospects:“Amazon. com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) delivered an impressive quarterly result that also came in well ahead of analyst expectations. Net sales increased 13% year-on-year to $143. 3 billion and operating profits increased 219% year-on-year to $15. 3 billion (vs the high end of guidance at $12. 0 billion). As has been the case for several quarters now, the highlight of the result was the significant improvement in profitability metrics, as management continues to drive cost efficiencies across its retail operations and Amazon Web Services (AWS). Amazon delivered to Prime members at its fastest speeds ever. In March, across the top 60 largest U. S. metro areas, nearly 60% of Prime member orders arrived the same or next day, and in London, Tokyo, and Toronto, 3 out of 4 items were delivered the same or next day. Bigger picture, we continue to believe that the market underestimates the length of the runway ahead in the core retail business (note that e-commerce sales in the U. S. still only make up 15% of total retail sales) and that there is still significant margin expansion ahead as scale and efficiency benefits continue to come through. ”Overall AMZN ranks 1st on our list of the best stocks to buy according to Warren Buffett and hedge funds. You can visit Warren Buffett and Hedge Funds Are Crazy About These 10 Stocks to see the other stocks that are on hedge funds’ radar. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

      "There's been a changing of the guard among the world's most valuable companies over the past 20 years, a shift that has accelerated since early 2023. Case in point: Back in 2004, General Electric and ExxonMobil were the world's largest companies in terms of market cap, valued at $319 billion and $283 billion, respectively. Now, just two decades later, industrial issues have been lapped by technology. Apple currently tops the list at $3. 3 trillion. Microsoft and Nvidia each briefly held the crown, currently worth $3 trillion and $2. 6 trillion, respectively. Tech titans Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta Platforms are also charter members of this elite society, worth $2 trillion, $1. 7 trillion, and $1. 3 trillion, respectively. With a market cap of just $24 billion (as of this writing), it might seem absurd to suggest that HubSpot (NYSE: HUBS) might be on track to join the $1 trillion club. However, the company's ever-expanding customer list, fast-growing market opportunity, and strategic integration of artificial intelligence (AI) could give HubSpot a clear path to membership in this exclusive fraternity. HubSpot may not be a household name, but the company pioneered the concept of inbound marketing. This strategy focuses on attracting potential customers by creating compelling and useful online content through social media and blog posts rather than annoying them with traditional ads. The company has since expanded its collection of offerings to include a wide array of unified customer relationship management (CRM) tools, including sales, marketing, service, operations, and content management systems (CMS). This strategy of gradually expanding its suite of interconnected offerings and boosting the capabilities of its existing products and services has served the company well. HubSpot's revenue has increased at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 38% over the past 10 years. Despite the current challenging economic conditions, that growth has continued, albeit at a more moderate pace. In the second quarter, HubSpot's revenue of $637 million climbed 20% year over year, while adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $2. 03 jumped 40%. This was driven by customer rolls that climbed 23% to 228,045, though the average revenue per customer slipped by about 2%. Management believes HubSpot's total addressable market (TAM), estimated at $51 billion in 2023, will rise to $77 billion by 2028. While management's outlook tends to be conservative, HubSpot has increased its forecast twice in as many quarters, guiding for revenue of $2. 57 billion in 2024, representing growth of 18% at the midpoint of its guidance. It's also worth noting that HubSpot began using AI long before it went viral last year. More than three years ago, the company introduced \"predictive lead scoring,\" using machine learning to sift through thousands of new leads and prioritize them based on how likely they are to convert. HubSpot added to its AI credentials last year, releasing a suite of AI-powered, generative AI-infused customer tools that have since been dubbed HubSpot AI. HubSpot made a name for itself by focusing its CRM efforts on the small and medium-sized businesses that were historically ignored by rivals. This has helped fuel the company's exceptional growth. HubSpot also has an enviable track record of retaining these customers as they grow into much larger and more lucrative businesses. That said, it will still be some time before HubSpot makes the list of trillionaires. According to Wall Street, HubSpot is expected to generate revenue of $2. 56 billion in 2024, an increase of 20%, giving it a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of roughly 11. Assuming its P/S remains constant, HubSpot would need to increase its revenue to roughly $89 billion annually to support a $1 trillion market cap, a feat that will be years in the making. If the company can maintain its double-digit year-over-year growth rate, HubSpot could reach the $1 trillion market cap threshold by 2044. That said, given its historical CAGR of 38% over the past 10 years, HubSpot's revenue could reaccelerate once the specter of inflation is in the rearview mirror. If the company can revert to its historical growth rate, HubSpot could potentially reach a $1 trillion market cap in roughly a decade. Given the company's $77 billion opportunity and management's track record of success, HubSpot seems destined to join the $1 trillion club, but investors will need to be patient.

Prediction: 1 Unstoppable Stock Could Join Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta in the $1 Trillion Club by 2034 was originally published by The Motley Fool\n",
      "Full disclosure: I own shares of Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and am bullish about its prospects. I think the company will continue to reign as the No. 1 e-commerce platform and cloud services provider. It won't surprise me in the least if Amazon's market cap doubles or more by the end of the decade. That said, Amazon won't be the biggest stock on the market despite delivering strong gains, in my view. I predict the following three stocks will be worth more than Amazon 10 years from now. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) briefly forfeited its throne earlier this year as the company with the biggest market cap. It could do so again. Nonetheless, I expect it will still be worth more than Amazon in 2034. Amazon's market cap is roughly $1. 5 trillion lower than Apple's right now. The only way it could make up that gap is if Apple performs dismally. I wouldn't bet on that happening. Sure, Apple's iPhone sales growth has evaporated in recent years. That could soon change, though. Apple Intelligence (the company's name for its generative artificial intelligence [GenAI] capabilities) will run only on iPhone 15 Pro and later models. Several Wall Street analysts project that GenAI could spark a huge iPhone upgrade supercycle. I agree with their reasoning. Don't overlook the potential for 6G to be another massive growth driver for Apple. The next generation of wireless technology could be available early in the next decade. It could be a game-changer in ushering in widespread adoption of augmented reality and perhaps even holographic displays on Apple's iPhones. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) isn't too far behind Apple, with a market cap hovering around $3 trillion. I don't see Amazon vaulting past the tech giant over the next 10 years, even if it delivers stronger growth (which I suspect could happen). Amazon and Microsoft share at least one key growth driver: organizations' migration of apps and data to the cloud. Although Microsoft Azure is a distant second to Amazon Web Services (AWS) in the cloud services market now, I think the gap will narrow over time. Microsoft's ace in the hole could be its relationship with OpenAI. It has already integrated GPT-4 throughout its product suite and cloud offerings. If GPT-5 fulfills its potential, it and future large language models (LLMs) developed by OpenAI and adopted by Microsoft could fuel tremendous growth for both companies. Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) market cap of $2 trillion isn't too much greater than Amazon's. I predict the Google parent will still be ahead of Amazon 10 years from now for a few key reasons. Like Microsoft, Alphabet could gain ground on AWS in the cloud services market. Its Google Cloud is already growing much faster than AWS. Google's AI expertise could enable it to accelerate this growth. I also think technologies of the future could provide massive tailwinds for Alphabet. The company is already racing to develop AI-powered agents that perform lots of tasks for customers. It's a leader in quantum computing. 6G could present a fantastic opportunity for Google Pixel smartphones and other Android devices. And with Waymo, Alphabet is poised to be one of the biggest winners in what could be a multitrillion-dollar robotaxi market. Will my prediction come true? I think so. However, there's a chance I could be wrong. Amazon's growth could be even better than I anticipate. The company could move into new markets more aggressively than before. It could out-innovate rivals, including those mentioned above. Any or all of the companies I expect to be bigger than Amazon 10 years from now could stumble. Apple's GenAI initiatives might not ignite an iPhone upgrade supercycle. Microsoft might be unable to capitalize on new AI developments from OpenAI for some reason (perhaps OpenAI stumbles or the two companies' relationship sours). Alphabet's Google Search dominance could disappear due to regulatory actions and/or new AI capabilities. Still, I wouldn't bet against Apple, Microsoft, or Alphabet -- or Amazon either. Instead, I own all four stocks and don't plan on selling them.

      "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks To Buy According to Financial Media. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon. com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other artificial intelligence stocks recommended by financial media. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has now become a technology that most people are increasingly familiar with. With AI seeping into almost every aspect of life, from the ads you see on social media apps to the autonomous driving cars many consumers are shifting to. It's not an overstatement to say that AI has become part and parcel of everyday life for every person using technology today. Considering the widespread use and application of AI technology, this area of the market has become an exciting area to invest in today. With the recent big tech companies' earnings being released, many investors are wondering what role AI is playing in the tech markets today, and how it will develop. On August 2, Databricks CEO Ali Ghodsi joined CNBC's \"The Exchange\" to discuss this very development. Here are some of his comments:\"I think what's happening is two things. On the one hand, it's macroeconomy, which has been sort of turbulent for a long period of time, and it seems to be now coming to an end, where we see it on the job market and people are seeing it on inflation and the 10-year coming down and so on. On the other hand, we see AI. People are very excited, they know it's gonna absolutely change the whole world, and that huge investments have been done by the hyperscalers in AI. But for us as a company, we've been investing in data and AI for the 10 years, and you know we see a steady growth revenue and customers getting value out of it, but theres been a huge deployment of capital. . . I think AI is gonna be amazing, it's gonna keep providing value. \"Ghodsi's comments clarify the market's current opinion on AI, namely that this is an area of tech that cannot be ignored and must be invested in to the maximum. However, in light of such a market opinion, many investors may be beginning to wonder whether the huge amounts of investments being made in AI are justified or whether we are merely in what some may call an \"AI bubble\" that is definitely going to burst. Considering the immense value to be found in AI, though, many investors believe that such huge deployments of capital are, in fact, justified. Considering the above, it's unsurprising that several big tech companies are part of the rat race to invest in and develop AI technologies. However, one notable absence in most lists of the best AI stocks to buy that are being made by financial media reporters is that of Apple. Many investors are beginning to take note of the fact that it is lagging behind other big tech companies that are rapidly developing AI tech. On August 6, Lightshed Partners' Walter Piecyk's shared his view on the smartphone maker's AI moves on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\". \"I signed up as a developer for the latest development or the latest release of iOS 18. I've been using the intelligent series - not that much better. . . There's a lot of work that's obviously gonna be done between now and when this is formally released. I just don't see it, for this year and for next year having some a big impact. \"Investors may be better served by shifting to purer AI plays. For this reason, we have compiled a list of the best AI stocks to buy according to financial media, to offer insights into what companies are actually doing well in the AI space today.

      "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Consumer Discretionary Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon. com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other consumer discretionary stocks. Many experts and analysts are concerned about a slowdown in consumer spending. However, reports show that consumer behavior is changing rather than slowing down. According to a report by Colliers Retail Market Intelligence, retail foot traffic rose by 4. 4% in June, indicating strong consumer activity despite flat overall sales. While furniture and home improvement stores saw declines due to reduced monumental purchases and a sluggish housing market, grocery stores, and apparel retailers performed better. Grocery sales grew by 1. 7%, with a nearly 5% increase in foot traffic, as consumers managed their budgets despite cutting costs. Apparel sales also increased by 3. 8%, driven by early back-to-school shopping and wardrobe updates, leading to an 8. 3% rise in foot traffic. In July, consumer spending saw a modest increase compared to June, with gains across 10 of 12 retail categories, as reported by the CNBC/National Retail Federation (NRF) Retail Monitor. Retail sales, excluding autos and gas, rose by 0. 7% month-over-month, slightly up from June's 0. 5%, but the year-over-year growth slowed to 0. 9%, down from 3. 4% in June. Core retail, which excludes restaurants, saw a 1% monthly increase. Significant sector performances included a 3. 4% rise in gas station sales and a 2. 1% increase in restaurant spending month-over-month. Conversely, the healthcare, personal care, and garden supplies sectors experienced slight declines. June and July data together indicate that consumer spending remains resilient, supported by strong household finances and a strong job market. While some sectors, particularly furniture and home improvement, are struggling due to reduced consumer confidence and a slow housing market, other categories are performing well. The data suggests that consumers are still willing to spend, especially on essential and seasonal items, though they may be more cautious with larger purchases. Despite some areas of decline, the overall retail environment appears stable, with consumers continuing to spend where they find value, which indicates a cautiously optimistic outlook for the remainder of 2024. In the July meeting, Fed Chair Jerome Powell highlighted the Fed's ongoing focus on achieving maximum employment and stable prices. He noted significant progress in the economy, with inflation dropping from 7% to 2. 5% and a balanced labor market with low unemployment at 4. 1%. The Fed chose to keep interest rates steady within the 5. 25% to 5. 5% range and continue to reduce its securities holdings to maintain a restrictive stance, which is aimed at aligning demand with supply and reducing inflationary pressures. Powell mentioned that while inflation has eased, the Fed is not yet ready to lower rates and requires more consistent positive data before making such a move, possibly as early as September. According to the CME Fed Watch Tool, all the experts are expecting cuts in September. 50. 5% of the experts predict a 25 basis points (bps) reduction in the interest rates while 49. 5% expect a 50 bps cut. Rate cuts generally have a positive effect on consumer spending. When interest rates are lowered, borrowing becomes cheaper, which could lead to increased consumer borrowing and spending. This increased affordability can boost consumer confidence and promote spending on discretionary items. That's a good set up for discretionary stocks, and with that, let's look at the 10 best consumer discretionary stocks to buy according to hedge funds. Our MethodologyFor this article, we used the Finviz stock screener to identify over 50 large-cap consumer discretionary stocks then narrowed our list to 10 stocks that were most widely held by institutional investors as of Q1, and listed the stocks in ascending order of hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

In addition to its retail offerings, the company delivers cloud computing solutions through AWS, digital streaming with Prime Video, and a range of consumer electronics, including Kindle e-readers and Echo devices.

As of March 31, Fisher Asset Management is the largest shareholder in the company and has a position worth $7. 68 billion. Amazon. com (NASDAQ:AMZN) has established itself as a dominant force in two of the most significant trends of recent years, online retail and cloud computing.

In the second quarter, the company reported a 10% increase in consolidated revenue compared to the previous year, driven by growth across all its business segments. The key driver of its profitability is Amazon Web Services (AWS), which leads the global cloud infrastructure market with a 32% share, according to Solganick, an independent investment banking and M&A advisory firm. AWS has proven to be a vital component of Amazon's financial success, supporting its overall growth. Amazon. com’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) website attracts over 3 billion visits each month, underscoring its extensive reach and influence in the online marketplace. Additionally, its advertising services have seen impressive year-over-year growth of around 20%, generating nearly $25 billion in revenue.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:“Among our top individual contributors in Q2 were Amazon. com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Texas Instruments and Mr. Cooper Group.

      "To say that Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ: PTON) has been struggling mightily would be an understatement. After experiencing monster success during the depths of the pandemic, the business has hit a rough patch, with weak demand, falling sales, and ongoing net losses. To solve these notable issues, it might make sense for Peloton to be acquired, which could potentially get it on a better financial path. And maybe that suitor should be Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), the dominant consumer tech juggernaut. Here are two things that investors should know about this speculative deal. Apple sells incredibly popular hardware products, like the iPhone, iPad, and MacBooks, that are supported by its own proprietary software offerings. Peloton operates a similar playbook. However, Apple has found tremendous success. And it's insanely profitable, boosted by a powerful brand and proven pricing power, something Peloton so desperately wants to have. To be clear, Apple already has a hand in the wellness space. The Apple Watch and Fitness+ app are its key offerings here. And CEO Tim Cook even went so far as to say that the company's biggest contribution to humanity \"will be about health. \" You can easily argue that Peloton also feels the same way about its own business. From a strategic perspective, buying Peloton could make sense. It would add to the over 2. 2 billion active Apple devices out there in the world. Peloton users are probably also coming from higher-income households that Apple could cross-sell to. And Apple could collect more fitness data that could bolster its ambitions in the health sector. There are interesting integration opportunities as well. If a consumer signs up and pays for Peloton equipment with an Apple Card, maybe a discount or other incentives will be offered. The Fitness+ and Peloton digital apps could be combined. And Apple Music could provide the tunes for Peloton's various workout classes. In the most recent fiscal quarter (Q3 2024, ended June 29), Apple reported more than $21 billion in net income. And it currently has $52 billion of net cash on its balance sheet. Even if Peloton sold at a huge premium to its current market cap of $1. 1 billion, Apple could easily afford the transaction. Based on what I just outlined, the deal makes sense. Apple would be a worthy buyer that Peloton shareholders can support. However, it's also easy to believe that an acquisition isn't going to happen. Despite being a gargantuan $3. 2 trillion business, Apple's corporate strategy doesn't really center on executing huge acquisitions. In 2014, the company completed its biggest deal when it purchased Beats for $3 billion. The price tag for buying Peloton would probably be in the same neighborhood. It's anyone's guess if executives would be comfortable doing this, when they could continue using excess cash to buy back shares and pay dividends. But I can understand why Apple shareholders would approve of such a deal. Even if it happened and it became a waste of capital, Cook and his team at least took a chance on something that seemed to make strategic sense. Apple could easily handle the financial loss in a worst-case scenario. There's also the obvious fact that Peloton is tiny by comparison, as it brought in $2. 7 billion in revenue in the last 12 months, versus the $386 billion Apple raked in during its trailing-12-month period.

      "Warren Buffett, arguably America’s most successful investor, is at it again. His latest moves in the stock market have captured the attention of investors. Under his control since 1965, he has led Berkshire Hathaway (BRK. A, BRK. B) to nearly double the performance of the S&P 500 with his calculated decisions. Don't Miss:Here’s the AI-powered startup that turns traders into influencers achieving 12% monthly growth – invest in it at only 10 cents per share. This startup is on the brink of a huge disruption to the $654 billion industry – Here’s how to invest in it before it fulfills its 800 pre-orders in the next 2 weeks. Buffett’s large stake in Apple (AAPL) has been a source of intrigue for years. Berkshire Hathaway began buying AAPL shares in 2016, and the technology giant became one of its largest holdings. Buffett previously had nice things to say about the technology giant, referring to it as a “better business” than other companies in Berkshire’s portfolio. Despite those positive comments, recent moves suggest Buffett is changing his strategy with Apple. See Also: Amid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity at just $500. According to a report by CNBC, Berkshire Hathaway drastically reduced its stake from 905 million in Apple as of December 2023 to 400 million by June 2024, a 55% decline. Nobody might have expected this since Buffett has been a big admirer of the tech giant. Perhaps this carries the sell-off reasoning toward Apple’s recent performance. The company still posted revenues of $85. 8 billion in the June quarter – 4. 8% above the same period last year – but the future outlook was grim. See Also: Don’t miss out on the next Nvidia – you can invest in the future of AI for only $10. Sales on the Chinese market, a key market for Apple, plummeted by 6%, and the company’s operating income fared even worse with a 10% decrease. It lost its previous position in the top five smartphone companies within China, while competitive brands such as Huawei and Xiaomi fared very well. These problems and a valuation that some analysts believe appears stretched may have prompted Buffett to reassess his stance. Despite trimming Berkshire's stake in Apple, Buffett remains bullish on another investment: Berkshire Hathaway. He has repurchased $5 billion of Berkshire shares in the last three quarters, indicating a bright outlook. “With our present mix of businesses, Berkshire should do a bit better than the average American corporation,” he wrote in a recent shareholder letter. Trending: Don’t miss the real AI boom – here’s how to use just $10 to invest in high growth private tech companies. Berkshire Hathaway’s financial results have been outstanding despite its ups and downs. In June, the company reported a 1. 2% revenue gain to $93. 7 billion and a 16% rise in operating earnings to $11. 6 billion. The insurance group did particularly well, with earnings from underwriting and fixed-income investment up 56%. However, Berkshire’s GAAP net income dropped by 16%, to $30. 3 billion, a number Buffett has called one that investors should pay very little attention to because of the volatility of unrealized gains and losses on stock investments. Trending: Commercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, and this platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000 offering a 12% target yield with a bonus 1% return boost today!Analysts have long forecast Berkshire’s operating earnings to increase 10% in 2024 and then reduce by 3% growth in 2025. With Buffett’s ongoing buyback program, this would have given the appearance that he is getting extreme value for Berkshire Hathaway, even as he reduces his exposure to other assets, such as Apple. Berkshire Hathaway could very well be a godsend for investors seeking a safe and stable long-term investment. If Warren Buffett continues to express so much faith in his own company, this might well be a green light for others to do the same.

      "Well, it's official: Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), the parent company of Google, has lost a landmark antitrust lawsuit in Federal court. On Aug. 5, Judge Amit Mehta ruled that Alphabet has illegally stifled competition in the online search market. In his 277-page ruling, Mehta concluded, \"Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly. \"So, what does this all mean for Alphabet and its stock? In this article, three Motley Fool contributors discuss Alphabet's prospects and how investors should react. Jake Lerch: In a nutshell, there are two key takeaways from the recent antitrust ruling:This ruling is a problem for Alphabet. However, it's far from catastrophic. First, let's examine why it's a problem. It should come as no surprise that losing the case is a negative outcome for the company. After all, at the very least, Alphabet will have to spend more time and money appealing the ruling (which the company has already announced it will do). That process will likely drag out for several more years. However, if Alphabet's appeals fail, the company will be forced to settle the lawsuit or accept the judge's yet-to-be-revealed remedies. Neither of those options is favorable, as they could mean paying tens of billions of dollars in fines and legal settlements. In addition, the government could seek changes to Alphabet's business practices. Specifically, the government now finds itself in a powerful position to demand alterations to Google Search -- which is the company's most lucrative business segment. All in all, this ruling introduces significant uncertainty to Alphabet and its stock. Yet there are silver linings. For one thing, the ruling focuses on Alphabet's practice of paying other companies to make Google Search their default search engine. Apple, for example, received over $18 billion in 2021 in exchange for making Google the default search engine across its products. Alphabet also has deals with Samsung and numerous other device makers, and Mozilla, the nonprofit project behind Firefox. Those agreements are now on the chopping block, which, in a strange twist of fate, may temporarily boost Alphabet's profits. Since the company won't be paying device makers like Apple to make its search engine the default, it should save billions of dollars per year. What's unclear is whether Google will lose significant search-engine market share in response, which would hurt profitability. In any event, there's no reason to believe that Google's search dominance will end quickly. As noted earlier, the appeals process will likely drag out for several years. In the meantime, Alphabet will continue to rack up billions in revenue and profits. So, while this ruling highlights why Alphabet isn't a stock for every investor, I remain bullish on it. Justin Pope: Alphabet's loss in the antitrust lawsuit shouldn't be a shock -- Google has over 90% market share of internet search worldwide. Ultimately, the company's anticompetitive tactics, including paying Apple nearly $20 billion annually to make Google the default search engine on iOS devices, were its undoing. So where does this go from here?Of course Alphabet will appeal, and the court will work to determine penalties ranging from fines to mandates. For example, the company could be forced to divest its Android business. Virtually every non-Apple smartphone -- about 70% of the world's phones -- uses Android software. Owning Android makes it easy for Alphabet to steer most of the world's smartphones to Google. This can all seem scary to investors because Google, which makes money through digital ads, is Alphabet's golden goose. But note a couple of things. First, this process will take time, perhaps multiple years, to finish playing out. There's no reason to panic-sell Alphabet stock. Second, Google probably deserves some benefit of the doubt. Most people who grew up with the internet have never used any search engine besides Google. After all, people don't search for things; they \"Google\" them. That's some serious brand power. Alphabet has also built an ecosystem around Google, including its popular web browser Chrome, and software like Gmail. The company has aggressively pushed artificial intelligence (AI) features into Google and has massive amounts of user data from years of dominating search. Knocking Google off won't be easy, even if mandates encourage others to try. So, while Alphabet's antitrust loss is noteworthy, let's pump the brakes and see how things play out. Until proven otherwise, Alphabet is one of the world's most dominant companies. Will Healy: Investors may not know what to make of the judgment that Alphabet's Google search engine is a monopoly. The company paid other companies like Apple and Samsung to make it the default search engine on their platforms. Although the government ruled such payments illegal, users don't pay Alphabet directly for using Google Search, leaving some wondering whether the ruling is relevant to the average consumer. Pending the likely appeals and possible punishments, Alphabet's short-term and medium-term prospects have become less clear. This may lead shareholders to sell, or at least not add shares. However, such news may actually be an argument for buying shares slowly; here's why. First, Google is widely perceived as the best search engine. Hence, even if it can no longer pay companies to be the default search engine, investors shouldn't assume that it will lose all or even most of its market share. That share currently stands at 91%, according to StatCounter. Secondly, Alphabet has slowly moved away from relying on revenue from advertising, most of which is driven by Google Search. Advertising has fallen from 87% of revenue in 2017 to 78% in 2023. So, while the judgment could speed the transition away from advertising, relying less on search was the company's plan anyway. Finally, Alphabet's efforts to move outside of search are technically advanced and well-funded. The company has utilized artificial intelligence in some form since 2001. And Google Cloud, its largest non-advertising segment, is the world's third-largest cloud infrastructure provider:Image source: Statista. Additionally, Alphabet holds $101 billion in liquidity. This means it can spend, and likely has spent, heavily on building these alternative businesses. Indeed, the hardest part for shareholders is waiting through the appeal, to see how any punishment could affect the company should Alphabet lose again. However, between the continued popularity of Google Search and a well-funded move away from its ad business, investors should probably consider adding shares on any significant pullback.

      "Surprising news has just come out of Omaha, Nebraska. Warren Buffett sold half of Berkshire Hathaway's monster stake in Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), adding tens of billions of dollars to the company's cash heap. At the end of last quarter, Berkshire Hathaway had $277 billion in cash and equivalents, giving it one of -- if not the -- world's largest cash reserves for an individual company. Berkshire's Apple investment was worth $84 billion at the end of the second quarter, down from $150 billion a few years ago. What is Buffett planning to do with Berkshire's cash? Why has he soured on Apple? And should you do the same for your portfolio? Let's take a closer look and find out. Apple reported earnings on Aug. 1 for the second calendar quarter of 2024. Its results have looked similar for the last few quarters. Hardware revenue has stagnated, with iPhone, iPad, and Wearables revenue all down in the first nine months of this Apple fiscal year versus the prior year. The only bright spot was the Mac, but that was a slight increase in sales. On a positive note, Apple services' revenue continues to climb. Revenue for the segment hit $71 billion over the last nine months, up from $63 billion in the same period a year prior. Services are a higher-margin business for Apple that comes from App Store fees, advertisements, Apple TV, and other software programs that it sells to customers. This has been the story for Apple for a long time. Even though Apple is not growing hardware sales, these new software products will drive growth for the company. Looking holistically, Apple's sales have not gone anywhere for a while. After the COVID-19 pandemic boost, revenue has been flat over trailing 12-month periods for a few years. In fact, revenue is still down from its peak at the end of 2022. One key reason for this is China. The region is important for Apple and has a weak consumer economy right now. Revenue in the first nine months of this fiscal year was $52 billion in China compared to $57. 5 billion a year ago. Apple's services business looks like all sunshine and rainbows, driving margins higher and higher. However, a good chunk of Apple's services revenue is simply a distribution payment from Google Search to be the default search engine on Safari. Apple reportedly receives over $20 billion a year from Alphabet for this distribution agreement, which comes at close to 100% profit margins. Analysts estimate that this payment may make up 15% of Apple's consolidated earnings power. Now, there is the risk this payment deal will come apart. A judge just ruled that Google Search's default distribution agreements are monopolistic, siding in the U. S. government in its case vs. Alphabet. This could be bad news for Alphabet, but it is even worse news for Apple. If it loses this lucrative distribution deal, Apple will see an estimated 15% of its profits evaporate overnight. And that is alongside stagnating top-line growth. The one gem of its business -- services -- could turn into a dud within a few years if the courts rule against Apple. AAPL PE Ratio data by YChartsEven though Apple's revenue is stagnating and its high-profit Google distribution payment is at risk of imploding, the stock was at an all-time high at the end of the second quarter. It is no surprise, then, to see Buffett selling some of his position. Today, the stock is a tad lower due to the broad market downturn. However, it still trades at an expensive-looking price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 31. 5. That is much higher than the S&P 500 average for a company with stagnating sales. Buffett likes to buy businesses closer to a P/E of 10, which is when he started buying Apple shares eight years ago. He clearly still likes the business -- it is Berkshire Hathaway's largest equity holding -- but the stock is very expensive at these prices. A low-growth stock with uncertainty around a large chunk of its profits and cash flow (the Google antitrust case) does not deserve to trade at over 30x earnings. Even Apple. Buffett understands this, which is why he is trimming his position. He would rather sit in short-term U. S. treasury bills that pay him a guaranteed 5% interest rate every year. If you hold Apple, this doesn't mean you should immediately sell your position. But if it is an outsize position in your portfolio like it was at Berkshire Hathaway, it might be smart to diversify your holdings along with Buffett.

      "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a scorching-hot buy over the past couple of years, largely due to the key role it plays in artificial intelligence (AI). The company's AI chips are crucial for companies that are developing AI models. And Nvidia has a commanding 80% market share when it comes to AI chips. That's part of the reason why investors have remained bullish on the stock -- it's arguably the best-positioned stock to benefit from growing demand for AI. But given how lucrative the opportunities are in AI, it's only a matter of time before more competitors emerge and fight for market share. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has recently turned to one of those unexpected competitors to source chips for its new AI-powered iPhones. One of the companies that has been developing its own chips is Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL). And Apple has been training its new AI system, called \"Apple Intelligence,\" using Alphabet's custom chips, according to a research paper. The company used two versions of Google's tensor processing unit to develop its AI models, which gives iPhone users access to generative AI features, including advanced writing tools, the ability to generate images, and a Siri assistant with \"all-new superpowers. \"Alphabet is a potentially strong competitor for Nvidia to worry about. The company has plenty of resources to work with. Last year, Alphabet generated more than $69 billion in free cash flow. It has been investing in its AI chatbot Gemini, and AI chips could provide it with yet another growth opportunity to pile money into. The courts recently found that the company's search engine, Google, has an illegal monopoly. And depending on what the consequences of that finding are, Alphabet may soon see a huge incentive to find a new growth opportunity to pursue, as the ruling may have a detrimental effect on a key part of its business. Beyond Alphabet, however, there are other competitors for Nvidia to worry about. Meta Platforms has been working on an AI chip of its own, as has Amazon. And investors also shouldn't forget about AMD, which is a more traditional rival for Nvidia. Although it has been late to the game, AMD has made it clear that AI is a big priority for the business, and it could also take away some sizable market share from Nvidia in the future. Nvidia has generated incredible gains due to its dominance in the AI chip space. And it is working on innovating and coming out with more advanced chips to ensure it remains on top. But maintaining such a large market share can be incredibly difficult, especially with so many big tech companies out there with deep pockets to contend with. They aren't simply going to ignore such a massive opportunity in AI chips. The company's revenue has taken off over the past year, with Nvidia's growth rate in recent quarters being well in excess of 200%. Those kinds of numbers, while extremely impressive, are also extremely difficult to maintain. At some point, Nvidia's growth rate will start to come down, especially if more competition emerges in the field. And its high-priced chips may also need to come down in price if that's the case, which may lead to both a slowing growth rate and smaller profit margins than the 50%-plus margins it has been averaging of late. Nvidia's stock has been giving back some gains in recent weeks, but it's still a top company to invest in if you want exposure to the red-hot AI market. While other companies may try to take market share from Nvidia, that doesn't mean that they will be able to do so overnight. Nvidia is still in an excellent position to continue growing, but I would expect its growth rate and margins to come down a bit in future quarters, especially as companies potentially reduce AI spending due to a possible economic slowdown. Nvidia's stock may struggle in the near term, but as long you're willing to hang on for the long term, it can still make for a good buy. Still, you should brace for some challenges ahead.

      "Investing in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) can provide you with some great diversification. But sometimes those ETFs can have significant exposure to just a few stocks, which negates the benefit of investing in ETFs for the purposes of diversification in the first place. And when you find a top-performing ETF that's doing extremely well, that's what you'll often find: It's doing well due to a few large positions. If you're investing in growth or tech-focused funds, you'll often find that tech giants Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft make up considerable positions in those ETFs. For example, the Invesco QQQ Fund has risen by around 150% in the past five years. The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund is up by 170%. You might think that these are phenomenal investments that can also give you some terrific diversification to keep your risk down. But is that really the case?Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft make up nearly 25% of the Invesco QQQ Fund's holdings. And that percentage climbs to more than 46% in the Technology Select fund. Depending on how this trio of stocks does, the ETFs will largely follow suit as well. Not only do these stocks make up a significant part of these ETFs, but they are also industry leaders; how they are performing can often be indicative of the overall tech sector. This raises a simple question: Are you better off just holding these three stocks, or an ETF?Let's suppose you invested $10,000 into each one of those big three stocks five years ago. If you did, the value of those investments would be worth a total of $353,000, with the bulk of that coming from Nvidia, which would be worth a staggering $280,000 just on its own. Now, what if you decided that the safer option was to invest all of that money into just an ETF. Together, that would mean you put $30,000 into a fund such as the Invesco QQQ ETF, which gives you a position in the top 100 non-financial stocks on the Nasdaq or the Technology Select fund, which focuses on the tech sector of the S&P 500. Let's also include the SPDR S&P 500 ETF, which can provide even greater diversification. Here's what a $30,000 investment from five years ago would be worth in each one of those funds today:Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund: $80,000Invesco QQQ Fund: $73,000SPDR S&P 500 ETF: $56,000Those returns don't come close to the gains you would have earned by just investing in the top three tech giants. Even if you exclude Nvidia and its oversized gains over the past couple of years due to its dominance in the chip market, your portfolio would still be worth around $73,000 from investing just $10,000 into Microsoft and Apple. At a combined $20,000, it would be a smaller investment and the gains would be comparable to what you would get with the QQQ Fund when investing $30,000. Peter Lynch famously referred to it as \"diworsification\" rather than diversification, simply because by trying to become too diverse, you end up sacrificing too much in the way of potential returns. Having a few good stocks can sometimes be better than having hundreds of smaller positions that end up resulting in underwhelming returns. Diversification can be useful if you're not comfortable picking stocks. But, by and large, investing in the top tech stocks has generally been a good move for investors over the years. While there will be bad years, in the long run, they are likely to generate great returns for your portfolio. And by going with the best and biggest names in the sector, you aren't necessarily taking on a whole lot of risk, either. If you're not familiar with a sector or just want extremely broad exposure, then an ETF may still be a desirable option for you. But for many investors, stock picking works fine as you don't have to go into the weeds and do a lot of digging to find good investments to buy and hold; oftentimes, the best and safest stocks to own aren't all that hard to find. Buying and holding shares of these three tech companies can be a better move than trying to find the right ETF.

      "Foxconn is hiring more shift workers with higher wages at the world's largest iPhone factory in the Henan provincial capital of Zhengzhou, ahead of the September launch of the 16th edition of Apple's iconic smartphone. The assembler, also known as Hon Hai Precision Industry, recruited more than 50,000 workers in Zhengzhou over the past two weeks, according to Chinese media reports. The hourly wage at the factory has risen to 26 yuan (US$3. 63) in August from 25 yuan in July, while a bonus of up to 7,500 yuan is on offer for returning staff with working experience at the plant, the National Business Daily reported, citing labour agencies.

Photo: SCMP/Cissy Zhou>The flagship factory is known for aggressive hirings ahead of major product launches, giving a high turnover rate for its workforce of more than 1 million staff. During the peak production season, the average monthly wage can range from 5,000 yuan to 7,000 yuan inclusive of extra work. During low seasons, the average wage can drop to between 3,000 yuan and 5,000 yuan, as overtime work becomes infrequent. Foxconn's officials did not respond to a request for comment on Sunday, outside normal business hours. Apple's next smartphone launch is one of its most anticipated events as the Cupertino, California-based company is counting on an upgrade with artificial intelligence (AI) built in to boost sales. It set the goal of shipping at least 90 million iPhone 16 devices in the second half of this year, a 10 per cent growth compared to the previous generation. Apple faces more competitions from local phone makers including Huawei, Xiaomi and Oppo. As China's smartphone market accelerated its growth momentum in the second quarter, Apple was squeezed out of top five vendors, with a 3. 1 per cent year-on-year decline in shipment despite cutting prices to promote demand, according to data from IDC. Greater China, Apple's third-largest market comprising the mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan, was the only declining regional market for Apple. The tech giant's revenue in the region dropped 6. 5 per cent to US$14. 73 billion in the June quarter, compared with last year. The uncertainty regarding the fate of much-anticipated Apple Intelligence in China's market could also weigh on iPhone sales in the country. Despite relocating some of its production bases out of China, Foxconn signed a deal in late July with the Henan provincial government for a new manufacturing project, for which it will invest 1 billion yuan to build new business headquarters and a research and development centre in Zhengzhou.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks recommended by Warren Buffett and hedge funds. Warren Buffett will go down in history as one of the most successful investors on Wall Street, a feat achieved through integrity, wisdom and wit. He is dubbed the Oracle of Omaha on his investment firm Berkshire Hathaway, delivering a compounded annual gain of 19. 8% since 1958, more than double an increase of 9. 9% for the S&P 500. Berkshire Hathaway stock has gained over 3,787,464% since 1965 compared to a 24,708% gain for the S&P 500, underlining Buffett's stock-picking skills. Buffett is one of the most accomplished investors in the history of Wall Street having amassed a wealth of $138 billion, as reported by Bloomberg's Billionaire Index. His net worth could have been much more had he not made generous contributions to various charitable organizations. In contrast to many other billionaires who prefer lavish lifestyles in large homes and luxury vehicles, Buffett is often seen as one of the most humble billionaires globally. The significant investment gains over the years stem from Buffett buying stocks in various sectors and holding them for years and even decades. Buffett's secret to prosperity mainly lies in investing in well-established, reputable companies with clear competitive edges. Although this approach focuses heavily on undervalued stocks, it also occasionally includes investments in high-growth companies. The investment strategy is often backed by the massive cash haul that Berkshire Hathaway holds on generating earnings per share on most of its investments and through dividend payments. Nevertheless, it is becoming increasingly clear that Warren Buffett and hedge funds are crazy about a particular clique of stocks. High-growth companies and market leaders in respective fields are some of the factors that Buffett and most hedge funds closely watch while selecting stocks.  Technology stocks which consist of some of the biggest companies account for 41% of Buffett's 13F portfolio at the end of March, an edge that has always allowed him to outperform the overall market. Diversification is another important factor in the top stocks that Warren Buffett and hedge funds are crazy about. While technology stocks account for the biggest share, the billionaire investor is also heavily invested in Financials at 21% and Basic Material at 10. 7%. Diversifying aligns with the billionaire investor value investing principles that involve pursuing undervalued investments in various sectors. Over the years, Buffett has always sought securities whose prices are undervalued relative to their intrinsic value. Rather than focusing on short-term gains in the market, the Berkshire Hathaway chief selects stocks based on their long-term potential. It was one of the reasons that Berkshire Hathaway shares ended 2023 with a 15. 8% gain, representing an eighth straight year of advances. Its biggest increase of 29. 6% came in 2021 at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. While Berkshire Hathaway had $189 billion in cash as of the end of the first quarter, the cash haul is expected to surge to $300 billion by the end of the third quarter. While most people might wonder why Buffett is not putting much of the cash to work, the billionaire investor is always cautious focusing on value investments rather than just investing for the sake. The billionaire investor is always driven by the mantra: never invest in overvalued equities. Therefore he always takes time scanning for value investments trading at discounted valuations. Additionally, the sheer size of Berkshire Hathaway means it can only put its money into a select few companies that will significantly impact its returns. This is further compounded by the fact that investments in cash equivalents, such as short-term government bonds, are currently offering returns above 5% which is quite high at current levels. As a result, Warren Buffett and his firm are deliberately seeking the perfect investment at the perfect price, and this opportunity could arise at any moment. In the recent past, Buffett has also gone against the wave amid a shift of focus from oil and gas investment plays amid the transition to clean energy. Buffett remains bullish about investment opportunities in the energy sector amid the carbon care initiatives even as the biggest players continue generating significant returns from the lucrative fossil fuel business. Buffett and hedge funds have also taken keen interest in stocks offering exposure to emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence that are driving valuations higher in the market. In this article, we take a look at some of the top stocks in which Buffett and other hedge funds are heavily invested. Warren Buffett and hedge funds are crazy about these 10 stocks partly because of their growth metrics and long-term prospects. While some of the stocks are trading at a premium valuation, they are market leaders in their respective fields and, therefore, well-positioned to generate long-term value. We have ranked the stocks in Warren Buffett's portfolio based on the number of hedge funds invested and selected the top 10. A wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers. Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 150Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the most valuable companies in the world in terms of market capitalization and is one stock that Warren Buffett and hedge funds are crazy about.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) is increasingly reducing its reliance on hardware sales, focusing on services led by Apple Music, cloud computing and App Store. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) confirmed that the integration of a slew of artificial intelligence features into its hardware is one factor expected to reinvigorate demand for its iPhones, which has slowed in the recent past. With AI expected to inject new life into Apple products, it remains one of the stocks worth paying attention to. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) remains Buffett's biggest holding, with stakes worth $135. 36 billion despite trimming stakes by 13% in the first quarter. A total of 150 hedge funds held stakes in the company as of the end of the first quarter, an improvement from 131 as of the aid of 2023. Overall AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the best stocks to buy according to Warren Buffett and hedge funds. You can visit Warren Buffett and Hedge Funds Are Crazy About These 10 Stocks to see the other stocks that are on hedge funds’ radar.

      "VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Aug. 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- B2Gold Corp. (TSX: BTO, NYSE AMERICAN: BTG, NSX: B2G) (“B2Gold” or the “Company”) announces its operational and financial results for the second quarter of 2024. All dollar figures are in United States dollars unless otherwise indicated. 2024 Second Quarter HighlightsTotal gold production of 212,508 ounces: Total gold production in the second quarter of 2024 was 212,508 ounces, including 8,267 ounces of attributable production from Calibre Mining Corp. (“Calibre”). Production at the Fekola Mine in the second quarter of 2024 was below expectations as a result of damage to an excavator and the delay in receiving replacement equipment which impacted equipment availability for the second quarter of 2024, reducing tonnes mined. These equipment availability issues are being addressed and mining rates are expected to improve by the end of the third quarter of 2024. Total consolidated cash operating costs of $839 per gold ounce produced, at the low end of the annual guidance range: Total consolidated cash operating costs (see “Non-IFRS Measures”) (including estimated attributable results for Calibre) of $839 per gold ounce produced during the second quarter of 2024 with consolidated cash operating costs from the Company’s three operating mines of $808 per gold ounce produced. Total consolidated all-in sustaining costs of $1,267 per gold ounce sold, below the annual guidance range: Total consolidated all-in sustaining costs (see “Non-IFRS Measures”) (including estimated attributable results for Calibre) of $1,267 per gold ounce sold for the second quarter of 2024 with consolidated all-in sustaining costs from the Company’s three operating mines of $1,244 per gold ounce sold. Total gold production for 2024 now expected to be between 800,000 and 870,000 ounces (including 20,000 ounces of attributable production from Calibre): Total gold production for 2024 is expected to be impacted by the delay in mining higher-grade ore from Phase 7 of the Fekola pit due to equipment availability issues, resulting in an expected decrease of approximately 50,000 ounces in Fekola production for full year 2024. Mining and processing of these ounces is now expected in the first half of 2025. Lower anticipated Fekola production is partially offset by increased gold production guidance at Masbate and Otjikoto, by 10,000 ounces combined. In addition, following the sale of a portion of the Company's equity interest in Calibre in June 2024, the Company will stop reporting its share of attributable Calibre production going forward. In 2024, B2Gold now expects total gold production to be between 800,000 and 870,000 ounces (including 20,000 ounces of attributable production from Calibre). The previous 2024 total gold production range of between 860,000 and 940,000 ounces included 40,000 to 50,000 ounces of attributable production from Calibre. Total consolidated all-in sustaining costs (including attributable results for Calibre) for 2024 now expected to be between $1,420 and $1,480 per ounce: Total consolidated all-in sustaining costs (including attributable results for Calibre) for 2024 are now forecast to be between $1,420 and $1,480 per ounce (original guidance range of between $1,360 and $1,420 per ounce). Attributable net loss of $0. 02 per share; adjusted attributable net income of $0. 06 per share: Net loss attributable to the shareholders of the Company in the second quarter of 2024 of $24 million ($0. 02 per share), primarily the result of a non-cash impairment of the Fekola Complex; adjusted net income (see “Non-IFRS Measures”) attributable to the shareholders of the Company of $78 million ($0. 06 per share). Operating cash flow before working capital adjustments of $192 million: Cash flow provided by operating activities before working capital adjustments was $192 million in the second quarter of 2024. Strong financial position and liquidity: At June 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $467 million and working capital (defined as current assets less assets classified as held for sale and current liabilities) of $600 million. Q3 2024 dividend of $0. 04 per share declared: On August 8, 2024, B2Gold's Board of Directors declared a cash dividend for the third quarter of 2024 of $0. 04 per common share (or an expected $0. 16 per share on an annualized basis), payable on September 23, 2024, to shareholders of record as of September 10, 2024. All planned construction for the first half of 2024 necessary to produce gold at the Goose Project by the end of Q2 2025 now complete and project development remains on schedule: B2Gold successfully completed the 2024 Winter Ice Road (“WIR”) campaign in the second quarter of 2024 and has delivered all necessary items from the Marine Laydown Area (“MLA”) to complete the construction of the Goose Project in the second quarter of 2025. The key construction items completed in the second quarter included the construction of three additional fuel storage tanks at the MLA to increase fuel storage capacity to more than 80 million liters of fuel, which are anticipated to begin to receive fuel in August 2024; the construction of three additional fuel storage tanks at the Goose Project site to increase fuel storage capacity to more than 80 million liters of fuel, of which two of the three tanks have been completed with the third tank expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2024; and the purchase of materials necessary to complete construction and the staging of those materials for shipment to the MLA during the 2024 sealift. Positive Preliminary Economic Assessment (“PEA”) results for the Gramalote Project; feasibility work has commenced: On June 18, 2024, the Company released the results of a positive PEA on its 100% owned Gramalote Project located in the Department of Antioquia, Colombia. Highlights of the PEA include a significant production profile with average annual gold production of 185,000 ounces over a 12. 5 year project life and strong project economics with an after-tax net present value discounted at 5% (“NPV5%”) of $778 million and an after-tax internal rate of return (“IRR”) of 20. 6%. B2Gold has commenced feasibility work with the goal of completing a feasibility study by mid-2025. Initial Inferred Mineral Resource Estimate announced for the Springbok Zone of the Antelope deposit at the Otjikoto Mine: On June 20, 2024, the Company released an initial Inferred Mineral Resource Estimate for the Springbok Zone, the southernmost shoot of the recently discovered Antelope deposit, located approximately three kilometers (“km”) south of the Otjikoto Phase 5 open pit at the Otjikoto Mine in Namibia. The Company determined that the initial Inferred Mineral Resource Estimate was sufficient to initiate a PEA on development of the deposit by underground mining methods, similar to the Wolfshag deposit. Subject to the receipt of a positive PEA and permit, mining of the Springbok Zone, coupled with the exploration potential of the greater Antelope deposit, could begin to contribute to gold production at Otjikoto in 2026. Partnered with Sandbox Royalties Corp. (“Sandbox”) to create Versamet Royalties Corporation (“Versamet”); B2Gold expected to receive $90 million equity interest in Versamet: On June 5, 2024, B2Gold entered into a purchase and sale agreement to sell a portfolio of 10 precious and base metals royalties to Sandbox, a private returns-focused metals royalty company, for consideration of 153. 2 million common shares at a price of C$0. 80 per share, representing an equity ownership interest in Versamet of 33. 0% valued at approximately $90 million.

For a description of how these measures are calculated and a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable measures specified, defined or determined under IFRS and presented in the Company’s financial statements, refer to “Non-IFRS Measures”. The Fekola Mine in Mali (owned 80% by the Company and 20% by the State of Mali) produced 111,583 ounces of gold in the second quarter of 2024, slightly below expectations due to the delayed timing of mining of high-grade ore as compared to expectations, resulting in less high-grade ore processed during the second quarter of 2024. For the second quarter of 2024, mill feed grade was 1. 51 grams per tonne (“g/t”), mill throughput was 2. 52 million tonnes, and gold recovery averaged 92. 8%. Damage to an excavator and the subsequent need for replacement equipment impacted equipment availability for the second quarter of 2024, reducing tonnes mined. These equipment availability issues are being addressed through the delivery of a new excavator, and mining rates are expected to improve by the end of the third quarter of 2024. The reduction in mining rate capacity experienced in 2024 is anticipated to impact the availability of higher-grade ore from Phase 7 of the Fekola pit during the second half of 2024 resulting in an expected decrease of approximately 50,000 ounces in Fekola production for full year 2024. Mining and processing of these ounces is now expected in the first half of 2025. Ore volumes and grades continue to reconcile well with modeled values. The Fekola Mine’s cash operating costs (see “Non-IFRS Measures”) for the second quarter of 2024 were $839 per gold ounce produced ($707 per gold ounce sold). Cash operating costs per gold ounce produced for the second quarter of 2024 were lower than expected as a result of lower fuel costs, higher mill throughput, higher gold recovery and lower mining costs as a result of lower than anticipated mined tonnage due to equipment availability. All-in sustaining costs (see “Non-IFRS Measures”) for the second quarter of 2024 were $1,258 per gold ounce sold. All-in sustaining costs were lower than expected as a result of lower than anticipated production costs per gold ounce sold and lower than expected sustaining capital expenditures partially offset by higher gold royalties resulting from a higher than anticipated average realized gold price. The lower sustaining capital expenditures were mainly due to timing of expenditures and are expected to be incurred later in 2024. Capital expenditures in the second quarter of 2024 totalled $53 million primarily consisting of $13 million for deferred stripping, $9 million for mobile equipment purchases and rebuilds, $9 million for the construction of a new tailings storage facility, $15 million for Fekola underground development, $4 million for solar plant expansion and $2 million for power generation. As a result of the delay in accessing higher-grade ounces from Phase 7 of the Fekola pit, the Fekola Mine is now expected to produce between 420,000 and 450,000 ounces of gold in 2024 (original guidance of between 470,000 and 500,000 ounces) at cash operating costs of between $870 and $930 per ounce (original guidance of between $835 and $895 per ounce) and all-in sustaining costs of between $1,510 and $1,570 per ounce (original guidance of between $1,420 and $1,480 per ounce). Fekola Regional DevelopmentThe Fekola Complex is comprised of the Fekola Mine (Medinandi permit hosting the Fekola and Cardinal pits and Fekola underground) and Fekola Regional (Anaconda Area (Bantako, Menankoto, and Bakolobi permits) and the Dandoko permit). The development of Fekola Regional is expected to demonstrate positive economics through the enhancement of the overall production profile and the extension of mine life of the Fekola Complex. Based on B2Gold's preliminary planning, Fekola Regional could provide selective higher-grade saprolite material (average annual grade of up to 2. 2 g/t gold) to be trucked approximately 20 km and fed into the Fekola mill at a rate of up to 1. 5 million tonnes per annum (“Mtpa”). Trucking of selective higher grade saprolite material from the Anaconda Area to the Fekola mill will increase the ore processed and has the potential to generate approximately 80,000 to 100,000 ounces of additional gold production per year from Fekola Regional sources. Receipt of a mining permit for the Fekola Regional licenses remains outstanding. The Company expects to apply for such a permit in the third quarter of 2024 following the finalization of the implementation decree for the new 2023 Mining Code by the State of Mali in July 2024. Throughout the first half of 2024, B2Gold has continued to hold meetings with the representatives of the Government of Mali regarding the 2023 Mining Code and the parties are close to finalizing an agreement that will cover the future operation of the Fekola Complex. The Government of Mali has expressed their desire for B2Gold to rapidly progress the development of Fekola Regional and committed to assisting the Company in such development. Importantly, the haul road from Fekola Regional to the Fekola Mine is operational as construction of the haul roads and mining infrastructure (warehouse, workshop, fuel depot and offices) was completed on schedule in 2023. The known and estimated changes to the financial framework of the Fekola Complex as impacted by the 2023 Mining Code and the ongoing discussions with the State of Mali as to its application are considered to be updated indicators of impairment for the Fekola Complex assets. The Company’s analysis concluded that the Fekola Complex was impaired resulting in a non-cash net impairment charge of $194 million in Q2 2024 and a corresponding reduction in the carrying value of the Fekola Complex assets at the balance sheet date. As of June 30, 2024, the carrying value of the Fekola Complex’s mining interests was $985 million. Significant exploration potential remains across the Fekola Complex to further extend the mine life. It is anticipated that exploration drilling will recommence in Mali in the second half of 2024.

The Masbate Mine in the Philippines continued its strong performance with second quarter of 2024 gold production of 44,515 ounces, slightly above expectations. For the second quarter of 2024, mill feed grade was 0. 94 g/t, mill throughput was 2. 04 million tonnes, and gold recovery averaged 72. 4%, lower than expected. Lower gold recovery was a result of mining additional lower recovery high-grade sulphide ore during the second quarter of 2024. Actual gold recovery for the second quarter of 2024 remained in line with modeled recovery values for the ore mined. The Masbate Mine's cash operating costs (see “Non-IFRS Measures”) for the second quarter of 2024 were $876 per gold ounce produced ($807 per gold ounce sold). Cash operating costs per gold ounce produced for the second quarter of 2024 were lower than expected as a result of higher gold production and lower than anticipated mining and processing costs due to higher productivity and lower diesel and heavy fuel oil costs. All-in sustaining costs (see “Non-IFRS Measures”) for the second quarter of 2024 were $1,135 per ounce sold. All-in sustaining costs for the second quarter of 2024 were lower than expected as a result of lower than anticipated production costs per gold ounce sold. Capital expenditures in the second quarter of 2024 totalled $7 million, primarily consisting of $2 million for mobile equipment purchases and rebuilds, $2 million for process plant maintenance, $1 million for expansion of the existing tailings storage facility and $1 million for deferred stripping. The Masbate Mine is now expected to produce between 175,000 and 195,000 ounces of gold in 2024 (original guidance of between 170,000 and 190,000 ounces) at cash operating costs of between $910 and $970 per ounce (original guidance of between $945 and $1,005 per ounce) and all-in sustaining costs of between $1,260 and $1,320 per ounce (original guidance of between $1,300 and $1,360 per ounce). Gold production is scheduled to be relatively consistent throughout 2024. For 2024, Masbate is expected to process 7. 9 million tonnes of ore at an average grade of 0. 93 g/t with a process gold recovery of 76. 0%. Mill feed will be a blend of mined fresh ore and low-grade ore stockpiles.

The Otjikoto Mine in Namibia, in which the Company holds a 90% interest, continued to outperform during the second quarter of 2024, producing 48,143 ounces of gold, above expectations as a result of higher than anticipated mill feed grade. For the second quarter of 2024, mill feed grade was 1. 79 g/t, mill throughput was 0. 85 million tonnes, and gold recovery averaged 98. 6%. Ore production from the Wolfshag underground mine for the second quarter of 2024 averaged over 1,500 tonnes per day at an average grade of 4. 69 g/t gold. As of the beginning of 2024, the Probable Mineral Reserve estimate for the Wolfshag deposit included 100,000 ounces of gold in 0. 6 million tonnes of ore at an average grade of 5. 02 g/t gold. Open pit mining operations at the Otjikoto Mine will continue to ramp down in 2024 and conclude in 2025, while processing operations are expected to continue until economically viable stockpiles are exhausted in 2031. Underground operations are currently projected to continue until 2026 with potential to extend underground operations if the ongoing underground exploration program is successful in identifying more underground mineral deposits. On January 31, 2024, the Company announced positive exploration drilling results from the Antelope deposit at the Otjikoto Mine. The Antelope deposit, which comprises the Springbok Zone, the Oryx Zone, and a possible third structure, Impala, subject to further confirmatory drilling, is located approximately three km south of the Otjikoto open pit. On June 20, 2024, the Company announced an initial Inferred Mineral Resource estimate for the Springbok Zone, the southernmost shoot of the recently discovered Antelope deposit. Over 36,000 meters have been drilled into the Springbok Zone to date, with 33 holes totaling 16,950 meters completed in 2024, to establish the 50 x 50 meter spacing that informs this initial Inferred Mineral Resource estimate. Recent drilling at the Springbok Zone remains open southward, indicating additional exploration potential beyond the currently defined resource. The Company determined that the initial Inferred Mineral Resource estimate of 1. 75 million tonnes grading 6. 91 g/t gold for a total of 390,000 ounces of gold was sufficient to initiate a PEA on development of the deposit by underground mining methods, similar to the Wolfshag deposit. Subject to receipt of a positive PEA and permit, mining of the Springbok Zone, coupled with the exploration potential of the greater Antelope deposit, could begin to contribute to gold production at Otjikoto in 2026. The Antelope deposit has the potential to be developed as an underground mining operation, which could complement the expected processing of low-grade stockpiles at the Otjikoto mill from 2026 to 2031. Mineral Resources that are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. There is no guarantee that all or any part of the Mineral Resource will be converted into a Mineral Reserve. Inferred Mineral Resources are considered too geologically speculative to have mining and economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as Mineral Reserves. The Otjikoto Mine's cash operating costs (see “Non-IFRS Measures”) for the second quarter of 2024 were $673 per gold ounce produced ($666 per ounce gold sold). Cash operating costs per gold ounce produced for the second quarter of 2024 were higher than anticipated due to lower than expected credits for deferred stripping resulting from more ore being mined than anticipated and lower capitalized underground development credits for the second quarter of 2024. All-in sustaining costs (see “Non-IFRS Measures”) for the second quarter of 2024 were $1,044 per gold ounce sold. All-in sustaining costs for the second quarter of 2024 were slightly higher than expected as a result of higher than expected cash operating costs and higher gold royalties due to a higher than anticipated average realized gold price, partially offset by lower than expected sustaining capital expenditures and higher than anticipated gold ounces sold. Capital expenditures for the second quarter of 2024 totalled $12 million, consisting of $9 million for deferred stripping in the Otjikoto pit, $2 million for Wolfshag underground mine development and $1 million for mining equipment rebuilds. The Otjikoto Mine is now expected to produce between 185,000 and 205,000 ounces of gold in 2024 (original guidance of between 180,000 and 200,000 ounces) at cash operating costs in the upper end of its guidance range of between $685 and $745 per ounce and all-in sustaining costs of between $960 and $1,020 per ounce. Gold production at Otjikoto is expected to be relatively consistent throughout 2024. For 2024, Otjikoto is expected to process a total of 3. 4 million tonnes of ore at an average grade of 1. 77 g/t gold with a process gold recovery of 98. 0%. Processed ore will be sourced from the Otjikoto pit and the Wolfshag underground mine, supplemented by existing medium and high-grade ore stockpiles. Goose Project Development The Back River Gold District consists of five mineral claims blocks along an 80 km belt. Construction is underway at the most advanced project in the district, the Goose Project, and has been de-risked with significant infrastructure currently in place. B2Gold recognizes that respect and collaboration with the Kitikmeot Inuit Association (“KIA”) is central to the license to operate in the Back River Gold District and will continue to prioritize developing the project in a manner that recognizes Inuit priorities, addresses concerns, and brings long-term socio-economic benefits to the Kitikmeot Region. B2Gold looks forward to continuing to build on its strong collaboration with the KIA and Kitikmeot Communities. As announced in May 2024, development of the open pit and underground was slightly behind schedule due to equipment availability (commissioning and availability of the open pit equipment), adverse weather conditions and the prioritization of critical path construction activities. An additional three months of mining was added to the schedule to ensure that the Umwelt open pit, underground development and crown pillar activities align and that there is significant tailings storage capacity in the Echo open pit. With the schedule change, the mill is expected to start wet commissioning in the second quarter of 2025 with ramp up to full production in the third quarter of 2025. This does not impact the other facets of the project and staffing tables have been adjusted to ensure that capital is conserved. The Company continues to estimate that gold production in calendar year 2025 will be between 120,000 ounces and 150,000 ounces (previously estimated to be between 220,000 ounces and 260,000 ounces). Importantly, the updated mining schedule does not impact the total number of gold ounces the Company expects to produce over the life of mine of the Goose Project. The updated production profile has resulted in the Company estimating that average annual gold production from 2026 to 2030 will increase to be in excess of 310,000 ounces per year (previously estimated at 300,000 ounces per year). B2Gold successfully completed the 2024 WIR campaign in the second quarter of 2024 and has delivered all necessary materials from the MLA to complete the construction of the Goose Project. All planned construction for the first half of 2024 that is necessary to produce gold by the end of the second quarter of 2025 has been completed and project development remains on schedule. The key construction items that were completed in the second quarter included the installation of Phase 2 of the Goose Project accommodation complex, which expanded camp capacity to more than 600 beds; the construction of three additional fuel storage tanks at the MLA to increase fuel storage capacity to more than 80 million liters of fuel, which are anticipated to begin to receive fuel in August 2024; the construction of three additional fuel storage tanks at the Goose Project site to increase fuel storage capacity to more than 80 million liters of fuel, of which two of the three tanks have been completed with the third tank expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2024; the purchase of materials necessary to complete construction and the staging of those materials for shipment to the MLA, with ten ships and one barge having been scheduled (seven ships with dry cargo of more than 120,000m3 and three ships with more than 80 million liters of fuel) and prepared to depart for the MLA during the 2024 sealift in August and September; the purchase of additional trucks for the 2025 WIR campaign, with a total of 105 trucks now available; the placement of more than 75% of the concrete, with more than 90% of the concrete expected to be placed by the end of the third quarter of 2024; the placement of all E-houses on the mill pad with electricians now working on connecting power to various components; piping work focused on the fuel storage tanks and the final Heavy Mechanical Equipment workshop; and the development of access for placement of piping and barge for fresh water system, with installation expected in the third quarter of 2024. Development of the open pit and underground remain on the critical path to ensure that adequate material is available for start up and that the Echo pit is available for tailings placement. The open pit started slowly, but showed good progress in the second quarter of 2024, meeting production targets, and is anticipated to be ready to receive tailings when the mill starts. The underground mine remains on schedule for commencement of production by the end of the second quarter of 2025. B2Gold is currently reviewing final options for mining of the crown pillar and maximizing volumes of the Echo pit. After completing a detailed design review of the Goose Project, B2Gold announced in January 2024 a revised construction capital estimate to C$1,050 million. In addition, before wet commissioning the Company estimated it will spend an additional C$200 million on underground development, deferred stripping and sustaining capital, as well as an additional C$205 million for fuels, reagents, and other working capital items necessary to build up site inventory levels due to the seasonality of the project logistics. In the second quarter of 2024, the Company incurred cash expenditures of $128 million (C$175 million) for the Goose Project on construction and mine development activities and $43 million (C$58 million) on supplies inventory. After successful completion of the 2024 WIR, it is anticipated that cash expenditures on construction and mine development activities will be lower in the second half of 2024 compared to the cash expenditures incurred in the first half of 2024. B2Gold is currently updating the total construction capital estimate to incorporate the (previously announced) three month delay in commencement of operations and additional costs associated with logistics of shipping materials to the Goose Project site via air transport. A final updated budget is expected to be released in early September 2024. Gramalote Project DevelopmentOn June 18, 2024, the Company announced positive PEA results on its 100% owned Gramalote Project located in the Department of Antioquia, Colombia. Based on the preliminary results completed in 2022, the contemplated larger-scale project with AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. did not meet the combined investment return thresholds for development. In 2023, B2Gold completed a detailed review of the Gramalote Project with the goal of identifying a higher-return project than the previously contemplated joint venture development plan. The results of the review allowed the Company to determine the optimal parameters and assumptions for the PEA. The PEA, with an effective date of April 1, 2024, was prepared by B2Gold and evaluates recovery of gold from an open pit mining operation that will move up to approximately 97,000 tonnes per day (“tpd”) (35. 3 Mtpa) with an approximately 16,500 tpd (6. 0 Mtpa) processing plant that includes crushing, grinding, flotation, with fine grinding of the flotation concentrate and agitated leaching of the flotation concentrate followed by a carbon-in-pulp recovery process to process doré bullion. The Mineral Resource estimate for the Gramalote Project that formed the basis for the PEA includes Indicated Mineral Resources of 192. 2 million tonnes grading 0. 68 g/t gold for a total of 4,210,000 ounces of gold and Inferred Mineral Resources of 85. 4 million tonnes grading 0. 54 g/t gold for a total of 1,480,000 ounces of gold. The PEA outlines a significant production profile with average annual gold production of 185,000 ounces over a 12. 5 year project life with a low-cost structure and favorable metallurgical characteristics. Additionally, the PEA outlines strong project economics with an after-tax NPV5% of $778 million and an after-tax IRR of 20. 6%, with a project payback on pre-production capital of 3. 1 years, and an estimated pre-production capital cost for the project of $807 million (including approximately $93 million for mining equipment and $63 million for contingency). A robust amount of historical drilling and engineering studies have been completed on the Gramalote Project, which significantly de-risks future project development. Based on the positive results from the PEA, B2Gold believes that the Gramalote Project has the potential to become a medium-scale, low-cost open pit gold mine. The PEA is preliminary in nature and includes a small amount of Inferred Mineral Resources that are considered too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as Mineral Reserves, and there is no certainty that the PEA based on these Mineral Resources will be realized. Mineral Resources that are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. B2Gold has commenced feasibility work with the goal of completing a feasibility study by mid-2025 and a $10 million budget has been approved by the Board. Due to the work completed for previous studies, the work remaining to finalize a feasibility study for the updated medium-scale project is not extensive. The main work programs for the feasibility study include geotechnical and environmental site investigations for the processing plant and waste dump footprints, as well as capital and operating cost estimates. The Gramalote Project will continue to advance resettlement programs, establish coexistence programs for small miners, work on health, safety and environmental projects and continue to work with the government and local communities on social programs. Due to the desired modifications to the processing plant and infrastructure locations, a Modified Environment Impact Study is required. B2Gold has commenced work on the modifications to the Environment Impact Study and expect it to be completed and submitted shortly following the completion of the feasibility study. If the final economics of the feasibility study are positive and B2Gold makes the decision to develop the Gramalote Project as an open pit gold mine, B2Gold would utilize its proven internal mine construction team to build the mine and mill facilities. OutlookTotal gold production for 2024 is forecast to be between 800,000 and 870,000 ounces, including 20,000 ounces of attributable gold production from Calibre. Based on current estimates, consolidated gold production in 2025 is expected to materially improve, driven by a significant increase in gold production from the Fekola Complex, relative to 2024, as a result of the scheduled mining and processing of higher-grade ore from the Fekola and Cardinal pits made accessible by the meaningful stripping campaign that will be undertaken throughout 2024, the expected full year contribution of higher-grade ore from Fekola Regional which is anticipated to contribute between 80,000 to 100,000 ounces of additional production, and commencement of mining the higher-grade Fekola underground (subject to receipt of necessary permits for Fekola Regional and Fekola underground). Upon completion of construction activities at the Goose Project, the mine is expected to commence gold production in the second quarter of 2025 and contribute between 120,000 and 150,000 ounces of gold production in calendar year 2025. Over the first five full calendar years of operation from 2026 to 2030, the average annual gold production for the Goose Project is estimated to be in excess of 310,000 ounces of gold per year. The positive PEA results on the Company’s 100% owned Gramalote Project, located in the Department of Antioquia, Colombia, outlines a significant production profile with average annual gold production of 234,000 ounces per year for the first five years of production, and strong project economics with an after-tax NPV5% of $778 million and an after-tax IRR of 20. 6% over a 12. 5 year project life. As a result, B2Gold has commenced feasibility work with the goal of completing a feasibility study by mid-2025 and a $10 million budget has been approved by the Board. Following the release of an initial Inferred Mineral Resource Estimate for the Springbok Zone, the southernmost shoot of the recently discovered Antelope deposit, in the second quarter of 2024, the Company has commenced a PEA which is expected to be completed in the first half of 2025. Subject to receipt of a positive PEA and permit, mining of the Springbok Zone, coupled with the exploration potential of the greater Antelope deposit, could begin to contribute to gold production at Otjikoto in 2026. The Antelope deposit has the potential to supplement the processing of low-grade stockpiles at the Otjikoto Mine through 2031, with the goal of increasing gold production levels to over 100,000 ounces per year from 2026 through 2031. The Company's ongoing strategy is to continue to maximize profitable production from its existing mines, maintain a strong financial position, realize the significant potential increase in gold production from the Company’s existing development projects, continue exploration programs across the Company’s robust land packages, evaluate new exploration, development and production opportunities, and continue to return capital to shareholders.

Management believes that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with IFRS, certain investors use this information to evaluate our performance and ability to generate cash flow. Accordingly, these measures are intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. The measures, along with sales, are considered to be a key indicator of the Company’s ability to generate earnings and cash flow from its mining operations. Cash cost figures are calculated on a sales basis in accordance with a standard developed by The Gold Institute, which was a worldwide association of suppliers of gold and gold products and included leading North American gold producers. The Gold Institute ceased operations in 2002, but the standard is the accepted standard of reporting cash cost of production in North America. Adoption of the standard is voluntary and the cost measures presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Other companies may calculate these measures differently. Cash operating costs and total cash costs per gold ounce sold are derived from amounts included in the statement of operations and include mine site operating costs such as mining, processing, smelting, refining, transportation costs, royalties and production taxes, less silver by-product credits.

The original World Gold Council standard became effective January 1, 2014 with further updates announced on November 16, 2018 which were effective starting January 1, 2019. Management believes that the all-in sustaining costs per gold ounce measure provides additional insight into the costs of producing gold by capturing all of the expenditures required for the discovery, development and sustaining of gold production and allows the Company to assess its ability to support capital expenditures to sustain future production from the generation of operating cash flows. Management believes that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with IFRS, certain investors use this information to evaluate the Company's performance and ability to generate cash flow. Accordingly, it is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. Adoption of the standard is voluntary and the cost measures presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. The Company has applied the principles of the World Gold Council recommendations and has reported all-in sustaining costs on a sales basis. Other companies may calculate these measures differently. B2Gold defines all-in sustaining costs per ounce as the sum of cash operating costs, royalties and production taxes, capital expenditures and exploration costs that are sustaining in nature, sustaining lease expenditures, corporate general and administrative costs, share-based payment expenses related to restricted share units/deferred share units/performance share units/restricted phantom units (\"RSUs/DSUs/PSUs/RPUs\"), community relations expenditures, reclamation liability accretion and realized (gains) losses on fuel derivative contracts, all divided by the total gold ounces sold to arrive at a per ounce figure.

The Company defines adjusted earnings per share – basic as adjusted net income divided by the basic weighted number of common shares outstanding. Management believes that the presentation of adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share - basic is appropriate to provide additional information to investors regarding items that we do not expect to continue at the same level in the future or that management does not believe to be a reflection of the Company's ongoing operating performance. Management further believes that its presentation of these non-IFRS financial measures provide information that is useful to investors because they are important indicators of the strength of our operations and the performance of our core business. Accordingly, it is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS.

      "Investors looking for stocks in the Mining - Gold sector might want to consider either B2Gold (BTG) or Triple Flag Precious Metals (TFPM). But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look. Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits. Right now, B2Gold is sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Triple Flag Precious Metals has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). This means that BTG's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. However, value investors will care about much more than just this. Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels. The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors. BTG currently has a forward P/E ratio of 9. 22, while TFPM has a forward P/E of 28. 59. We also note that BTG has a PEG ratio of 0. 39. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. TFPM currently has a PEG ratio of 0. 88. Another notable valuation metric for BTG is its P/B ratio of 0. 91. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, TFPM has a P/B of 1. 59. These are just a few of the metrics contributing to BTG's Value grade of A and TFPM's Value grade of D. BTG stands above TFPM thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that BTG is the superior value option right now.

      "Bradesco (NYSE:BBD), a major player in Latin American banking, has lagged behind its peers due to a challenging macroeconomic environment and less efficient asset management. Despite efforts at a robust turnaround, I currently take a neutral stance on BBD. While BBD trades at a discount compared to its local competitors, the investment thesis for Bradesco hinges more on its turnaround strategy than on solid fundamentals. I believe when it comes to investing in banking stocks, this shouldn’t be the ideal approach. In this article, I’ll delve deeper into why Bradesco finds itself in this predicament. Bradesco stands among Brazil’s private banking giants, competing head-to-head with Itaú Unibanco (NYSE:ITUB) and Santander Brasil (NYSE:BSBR) while also contending with state-owned banks like Banco do Brasil (OTC:BDORY) and Caixa Econômica Federal. Its business model spans banking and insurance, targeting Brazil’s middle-class and low-income demographics. However, this diverse credit portfolio has posed challenges, causing Bradesco to underperform compared to some of its local rivals. The bank has faced stiff competition from digital banks like Nu Holdings (NYSE:NU) and Inter & Co (NASDAQ:INTR), hindering its growth in recent years. Adding to its challenges, Brazil’s credit environment has been declining, though a modest recovery is anticipated in 2024. Bradesco has struggled with rising default rates, with its 90-day non-performing loans (NPL 90+) spiking from 2. 6% in March 2021 to a peak of 7. 2% by September last year, though it has since eased to 6. 4% as of March 2024. Several factors contributed to this surge. First, Brazil’s inflation soared due to the COVID-19 pandemic, hitting 12% early in 2022. Second, credit growth slowed throughout 2023, spurred by double-digit interest rates aimed at curbing inflation. Alongside these macroeconomic pressures affecting the entire banking sector, Bradesco faced a more specific issue. Due to its substantial exposure to retail credit, Bradesco set aside an extra provision of R$4. 9 billion (over a billion USD) in February last year to cover its exposure to an accounting scandal involving the retailer Americanas, which severely impacted the bank’s bottom line. Consequently, Bradesco saw a sharp decline in its profitability from 2022 to 2023. The bank’s return on average equity (ROAE) plummeted from 18. 7% in Q1 2021 to 10. 2% in Q1 2024, which explains why its stock has depreciated by approximately 64% over the past five years. For comparison, Itaú Unibanco and Banco do Brasil, the top performers in the industry, reported an ROE of over 21% in the latest quarter. Comparing Bradesco’s stock performance with its main domestic peers reveals it has performed the worst over this period. To turn around the adverse situation of the past five years, Bradesco has embarked on a comprehensive operational restructuring. In November 2023, Bradesco announced Marcelo Noronha as its new CEO. By February 2024, Bradesco unveiled a strategic restructuring plan set to be implemented through 2028. This plan includes significant changes, particularly at the C-Level, aimed at optimizing cross-selling processes and re-segmenting the bank’s service areas. The primary goal is to enhance efficiency, targeting a 40% efficiency ratio (where lower is better). In Q1 2024, the bank reported a 50% ratio. Achieving this target will require meticulous management of operating expenses, and while this will take time, some progress is already evident this year. First, there was an improvement in provisions. In Q1 2024, Bradesco reported an almost 18% drop in provisions compared to Q1 last year, totaling R$7. 8 billion. Operating expenses fell 10. 5% quarter-over-quarter to $13. 4 billion, though they were up 4% year-over-year. Bradesco posted a net profit of R$4. 2 billion, a significant 46% increase quarter-over-quarter, though a slight 1. 6% drop year-over-year. Its annual return on average equity (ROAE) of 10. 2% marked an improvement of 3. 3 percentage points quarterly but was partially offset by the 0. 4 percentage points drop year-over-year, still trailing the bank’s historical levels. Although the turnaround is progressing slowly, these are small victories for Bradesco’s shareholders to celebrate. The current scenario also highlights the rather derisked valuation multiples at which Bradesco has been trading. The bank trades at a P/B ratio of 0. 7x, indicating more about market concerns over the bank’s future profitability than necessarily viewing BBD as undervalued. In the past three months, only Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) analyst Mario Pierry has weighed in on Bradesco stock with a Hold recommendation. Despite his neutral stance, Pierry has set a price target of $3. 20 per share on BBD stock, suggesting substantial upside potential of 38. 8%. Bradesco has been the laggard among Brazilian banks, taking the hardest hits due to its focus on middle and low-income customers, making it more vulnerable to economic headwinds. The weighty provisioning for the Americanas scandal further dragged down its performance, squeezing its efficiency. Now, management is racing against the clock to turn this sleeping prominent Brazilian bank around. While the conditions might be improving for a recovery, betting on a downturn is a risky play, and the bullish case doesn’t quite shine, either. Disclosure\n",
      "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Bank Penny Stocks to Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Banco Bradesco S. A. (NYSE:BBD) stands against the other bank penny stocks. The US banking sector in 2024 faces various challenges and opportunities. Although the industry has recovered from the bank failures of early 2023, it now deals with a slower economy, tighter regulations, and the possibility of interest rate cuts, all of which present risks for the sector. In the past year, the US banking sector observed the collapse of a couple of well-known banks, which led to uncertainty in regional bank stocks. When considering the broader context, last year's bank closures were not particularly notable in terms of quantity. The year's total of five closures pales in comparison to 2009 and 2010, which saw 140 and 157 closures, respectively. However, 2023 stood out due to the substantial total assets of the affected institutions, primarily driven by the significant sizes of First Republic Bank, Silicon Valley Bank, and Signature Bank. The banks were also heavily funded by uninsured deposits, as a significant portion of their customers held deposits exceeding the FDIC insurance limit of $250,000. This increased their risk during sector volatility. Despite these closures and the following instability, many bank stocks regained stability and ended 2023 with positive returns. The economic outlook indicates slower growth and the possibility of a rate cut in 2024. This may result in a dip in bank profitability, although it is expected to remain strong, with an anticipated return on common equity ranging from 10% to 11%. Moreover, asset quality is predicted to weaken but should remain manageable, with strong pre-provision earnings providing support. There are economic risks to consider, including the potential for a recession if the Federal Reserve is not careful enough with rate cuts, as well as the persistent threat of inflation that could result in prolonged high rates. Moreover, credit card charge-offs are anticipated to rise. However, banks with more diversified deposit bases and fewer uninsured deposits are less likely to face high risks as compared to those with more uninsured deposits. Regulatory changes, including the finalization of new capital and resolution requirements, may be implemented in 2024 in response to the banking failures of the previous year. Despite these challenges, the banking sector is expected to maintain strong profitability and capital buildup, aided by a potentially more favorable rate environment later in the year. Moreover, there are potential investment opportunities in regional banks perceived as undervalued. With this context in mind, let's take a look at the best bank penny stocks to buy now. To compile a list of the 10 best bank penny stocks to buy, we conducted an in-depth analysis. Our first step was to identify banks with share prices below $5.

      "Bank dividend stocks like JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) and Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) are in the limelight amid rising interest rates and the market's overall hunger for steady dividends. Central banks have been actively increasing support for markets by allowing bank reserves to grow. This expansion in reserves increases the amount of money available for banks to invest in both the markets and the broader economy. This action essentially provides banks with more capital, enabling them to have greater resources to allocate toward investments in financial markets and lending to businesses and individuals. Research conducted by Matt King, previously a strategist at Citigroup and now leading his independent research firm, Satori Insights, proposes a noteworthy shift in focus. Rather than concentrating on the Federal Reserve's reduction in its overall balance sheet, King highlights the paramount importance of understanding the considerable $500 billion surge in reserves within the U. S. banking system since January.

      "(Reuters) - If the U. S. Federal Reserve does not start cutting interest rates relatively soon, U. S. consumers could become dispirited, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan said on Sunday. At the end of July the Fed kept the policy rate in the same 5. 25%-5. 50% range it has been for more than a year, but signaled that a rate cut could come as soon as September if inflation continued to cool. \"They've told people rates probably aren't going to go up, but if they don't start taking them down relatively soon, you could dispirit the American consumer,\" Moynihan told CBS in an interview. \"Once the American consumer really starts going very negative, then it's hard to get them back. \"Moynihan, pressed about Republican candidate Donald Trump's statement that presidents should have a say over Fed decisions, said people were free to give Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell advice and it was then his job to decide what to do. \"If you look around the world's economies and you see where central banks are independent and operate freely, they tend to fare better than the ones that don't,\" he said.

      "We recently compiled a list of the Warren Buffett and Hedge Funds Are Crazy About These 10 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) stands against the other stocks recommended by Warren Buffett and hedge funds. Warren Buffett will go down in history as one of the most successful investors on Wall Street, a feat achieved through integrity, wisdom and wit. He is dubbed the Oracle of Omaha on his investment firm Berkshire Hathaway, delivering a compounded annual gain of 19. 8% since 1958, more than double an increase of 9. 9% for the S&P 500. Berkshire Hathaway stock has gained over 3,787,464% since 1965 compared to a 24,708% gain for the S&P 500, underlining Buffett's stock-picking skills. Buffett is one of the most accomplished investors in the history of Wall Street having amassed a wealth of $138 billion, as reported by Bloomberg's Billionaire Index. His net worth could have been much more had he not made generous contributions to various charitable organizations. In contrast to many other billionaires who prefer lavish lifestyles in large homes and luxury vehicles, Buffett is often seen as one of the most humble billionaires globally. The significant investment gains over the years stem from Buffett buying stocks in various sectors and holding them for years and even decades. Buffett's secret to prosperity mainly lies in investing in well-established, reputable companies with clear competitive edges. Although this approach focuses heavily on undervalued stocks, it also occasionally includes investments in high-growth companies. The investment strategy is often backed by the massive cash haul that Berkshire Hathaway holds on generating earnings per share on most of its investments and through dividend payments. Nevertheless, it is becoming increasingly clear that Warren Buffett and hedge funds are crazy about a particular clique of stocks. High-growth companies and market leaders in respective fields are some of the factors that Buffett and most hedge funds closely watch while selecting stocks.  Technology stocks which consist of some of the biggest companies account for 41% of Buffett's 13F portfolio at the end of March, an edge that has always allowed him to outperform the overall market. Diversification is another important factor in the top stocks that Warren Buffett and hedge funds are crazy about. While technology stocks account for the biggest share, the billionaire investor is also heavily invested in Financials at 21% and Basic Material at 10. 7%. Diversifying aligns with the billionaire investor value investing principles that involve pursuing undervalued investments in various sectors. Over the years, Buffett has always sought securities whose prices are undervalued relative to their intrinsic value. Rather than focusing on short-term gains in the market, the Berkshire Hathaway chief selects stocks based on their long-term potential. It was one of the reasons that Berkshire Hathaway shares ended 2023 with a 15. 8% gain, representing an eighth straight year of advances. Its biggest increase of 29. 6% came in 2021 at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. While Berkshire Hathaway had $189 billion in cash as of the end of the first quarter, the cash haul is expected to surge to $300 billion by the end of the third quarter. While most people might wonder why Buffett is not putting much of the cash to work, the billionaire investor is always cautious focusing on value investments rather than just investing for the sake. The billionaire investor is always driven by the mantra: never invest in overvalued equities. Therefore he always takes time scanning for value investments trading at discounted valuations. Additionally, the sheer size of Berkshire Hathaway means it can only put its money into a select few companies that will significantly impact its returns. This is further compounded by the fact that investments in cash equivalents, such as short-term government bonds, are currently offering returns above 5% which is quite high at current levels. As a result, Warren Buffett and his firm are deliberately seeking the perfect investment at the perfect price, and this opportunity could arise at any moment. In the recent past, Buffett has also gone against the wave amid a shift of focus from oil and gas investment plays amid the transition to clean energy. Buffett remains bullish about investment opportunities in the energy sector amid the carbon care initiatives even as the biggest players continue generating significant returns from the lucrative fossil fuel business. Buffett and hedge funds have also taken keen interest in stocks offering exposure to emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence that are driving valuations higher in the market. In this article, we take a look at some of the top stocks in which Buffett and other hedge funds are heavily invested. Warren Buffett and hedge funds are crazy about these 10 stocks partly because of their growth metrics and long-term prospects. While some of the stocks are trading at a premium valuation, they are market leaders in their respective fields and, therefore, well-positioned to generate long-term value. We have ranked the stocks in Warren Buffett's portfolio based on the number of hedge funds invested and selected the top 10. A professional banker providing consultation to a customer in the security of his office. Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 82Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) is Berkshire Hathaway's largest holding in the financial services sector, with stakes worth $39. 2 billion. It is also one of the top stocks that Warren Buffett and hedge funds are crazy about, having gained about 40% over the past 12 months.

Analysts at ClearBridge Value Equity Strategy believe the pressures Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) faced last year have subsided, and it is well-positioned to deliver impressive results in 2024. Here is what ClearBridge Value Equity Strategy said about Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:“We added several new positions during the quarter. Our largest new addition was Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), one of the world’s leading financial institutions, serving some 66 million consumer and small business clients across the U. S. as well as large corporations, financial institutions and governments globally. We believe that the interest rate pressure that Bank of America faced in early 2023 has subsided, and risks surrounding deposit outflows have abated, which should allow the company to improve its book value and capital growth as well as benefit from a rebound of capital markets activity. ”Overall BAC ranks 6th on our list of the best stocks to buy according to Warren Buffett and hedge funds.

      "We recently published a list of Jim Cramer is Talking About These 10 Stocks as Markets Rebound. Since Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) ranks 3rd on the list, it deserves a deeper look. Jim Cramer in his latest program on CNBC talked about the latest rebound in the markets followed by a major selloff on Monday, saying we can “fret” about the interest rates, jobs market or mortgage rates, or we can just buy the stocks of “tremendous” companies and hold on to them. “Stock prices have become so dependent on the macro, the carry trade, the Fed chatter, that it’s impossible to give you a pat answer even as I’ve told you over and over again that corporate America is doing much better than anyone would expect at this point in the cycle,” Cramer said. Cramer lamented yet again that people believe a 25bps decline in interest rates could somehow “motivate” people to increase spending and on these hopes they often buy “phony” ETFs. Cramer also said that the Fed won’t begin to cut rates until it sees consumers “rebelling” against higher prices forcing companies to roll back price increases to pre-COVID levels. Jim Cramer believes we now have an “empowered consumer” who is willing to make choices and choose options that are cheaper and better. ” He said that during the pandemic, amid higher liquidity, people were willing to accept higher prices, but not anymore. For this article we watched several latest programs of Jim Cramer and picked 10 stocks he’s talking about. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 82Cramer in a latest program recommended a caller to buy Bank of America “right here,” saying:“I think this company is selling very inexpensively and it’s a good one. ”Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) recently posted strong-than-expected Q2 results and gave strong guidance for net interest income despite rate cut expectations. Bank of America profited from rising interest rates by raising loan rates while delaying increases for depositors. Over the past two years, higher rates from the central bank boosted its net interest income significantly. In the second quarter of 2024 Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) earned $13. 9 billion in net interest income, a $300 million decrease from the previous quarter. Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) forecasts a $600 million increase in net interest income for 2024, despite expecting three interest rate cuts. This projected boost is expected to strengthen the bank’s financial position and sustain its bullish trend. The bank’s stock remains attractively valued with a positive risk/reward outlook. A significant positive development for Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) this year is the rise in investment banking fees, which increased 29% year-over-year in Q2, contributing 17. 3% to net income. Continued growth in these fees is expected to further enhance the bank’s profitability. ClearBridge Value Equity Strategy stated the following regarding Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:“We added several new positions during the quarter.

      "Bonuses are on track to rise once again for some Wall Street bankers as a dealmaking revival in 2024 boosts profits for the country’s biggest financial institutions. The biggest paydays will likely go to bankers involved in debt and equity underwriting, as well as traders. Debt underwriters are likely to see a boost of 25% to 35% in their incentive pay while those who help companies issue equity via initial public offerings are expected to see 20% to 30% bonus pay rises, according to a new report from compensation consulting firm Johnson Associates. Bonuses in equity sales and trading are expected to increase 10% to 15% from last year. Fixed-income traders and asset and wealth managers should see bumps of 5% to 10%. These increases that are expected at major Wall Street banks would reverse two disappointing years where deals dried up and bonuses shrank. Bonuses at major banks fell 20% to 30% in 2022 and remained largely flat through last year, according to Johnson Associates. But this year investment banking has recovered. The six major banks with sizable Wall Street operations — JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C), Goldman Sachs (GS), Morgan Stanley (MS), and Wells Fargo (WFC) — all reported higher revenues in that business during the second quarter. Stocks for those six big lenders are all up year to date. Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Bank of America, and Citigroup have all outperformed an index tracking the sector (^BKX). That index was up 10% as of Friday morning. However, not all operations at these firms are firing on all cylinders — and that could have an effect on compensation for some bankers. Those who handle mergers and acquisitions, for example, are expected to see bonuses that are flat to up to 5%, according to Johnson Associates. There is still uncertainty in that part of Wall Street due to a regulatory crackdown on some mergers, the path of interest rates, and a US presidential election. Bankers who handle the more traditional tasks of lending to companies and everyday consumers may also see smaller bonuses. Their incentive compensation is expected to be flat to down 5%. Those more traditional bankers are grappling with a continued industry wide slump in plain vanilla bank lending as well as heightened caution around commercial real estate transactions. \"Second half of year may be more volatile and uncertain\" in light of a weaker stock market that could be signaling that the economy is softening, Johnson Associates said in its report.

      "The main point of investing for the long term is to make money. But more than that, you probably want to see it rise more than the market average. Unfortunately for shareholders, while the Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) share price is up 46% in the last five years, that's less than the market return. Some buyers are laughing, though, with an increase of 23% in the last year. While this past week has detracted from the company's five-year return, let's look at the recent trends of the underlying business and see if the gains have been in alignment. Check out our latest analysis for Bank of America There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS). Over half a decade, Bank of America managed to grow its earnings per share at 0. 8% a year. This EPS growth is lower than the 8% average annual increase in the share price. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth. You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image). We like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Bank of America's earnings, revenue and cash flow. When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of Bank of America, it has a TSR of 65% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!It's good to see that Bank of America has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 27% in the last twelve months. And that does include the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 11% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. Investors who like to make money usually check up on insider purchases, such as the price paid, and total amount bought.

      "There’s at least 11 ways to get scammed on Zelle, the payment app owned by JP Morgan, Bank of America and other large American banks. But Zelle’s chief fraud risk manager, Ben Chance, thinks the app is doing everything it should to prevent them. Beyond that, he says, the responsibility for shutting down scammers lies with you, law-makers, and the law enforcement agencies supposed to protect you. In a far reaching conversation with Fortune, Chance addressed concerns raised in a Zelle-related investigation reportedly underway by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The probe targets JPMorgan, Bank of America and Wells Fargo—while a JP Morgan filing last week suggested the bank may pre-empt the investigation by suing the CFPB, which is tasked with ensuring banks’ treatment of their users are fair, transparent and legal. JPMorgan confirmed they are under investigation. Wells Fargo and Bank of America declined to comment. The CFPB declined to comment. Chance, who joined Zelle last year after a career working at banks including Goldman Sachs, Capital One and Barclays, detailed what Zelle is already doing and why he thinks its sufficient. As part of a broader effort with the U. S. Treasury Department and the Zelle owners, he called for better education of users, sound policy and more funding for law enforcement. “The real solution,” says Chance, “is to focus on the criminals who are perpetrating these crimes across phone, text message, email, digital marketplaces and social media platforms…and of course, partnering with those platforms, along with financial services and law enforcement in the prosecution and removal of these criminal actors. ”Zelle’s creator, Early Warning Services, was founded in 1990 to help banks protect their clients before they are harmed. The consortium of owners, which also includes Truist, Capital One, PNC Financial Services Group, and U. S. Bancorp, launched Zelle in 2017 to compete with payment apps like Venmo and Cash App. Scammers have since then supercharged elaborate ploys to trick users into sending them money, largely relying on what’s called “spoofing,” or pretending to be a bank, a boss, or someone else the user trusts. While Zelle and its owners claim to be complying or exceeding legal requirements to make their users whole, not everyone agrees. On Monday, U. S. Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Chair of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations wrote a letter to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau calling for an investigation, and claiming that between 2019 and 2023 the total percentage of reimbursed Zelle fraud claims fell from 62% to 38%. To give an idea of the potential magnitude of the problem, consumers have spent more than $2. 3 trillion using Zelle, according to a testimony submitted to Senator Blumenthal by Mark Monaco, the head of Bank of America’s global payment solutions. $370 billion of that came from Bank of America alone. Monaco said that fewer than five in 10,000 Zelle transfers sent by Bank of America customers last year resulted in a customer contacting them to complain about lossesZelle’s Chance says one possible explanation for the decrease of reimbursements is that fewer legitimate scams are being perpetrated. Last month he published a report saying that while Zelle volume grew by 28% from 2022 to 2023 there was a nearly 50% decrease in reports of fraud and scam payments processed on the network. In part, he attributes that to Zelle’s anti-scam education program featuring actress Christina Ricci, which he says has been viewed by 40 million people, and two in-app warnings before a payment is sent, which he says were sent 700 million times last year. And yet the problem persists. Regulators have been trying to get a grip on slippery scams since at least 1991, when President George H. W. Bush signed the Telephone Consumer Protection Act into law. But that effort, and subsequent ones in 2003 and 2009, have failed to stop the flood of scammers. A scammer using robocalls banned from telemarketing in 2013 simply ignored the prohibition, and allegedly made another 5 billion calls to Americans from Panama and Hungry. Other scammers move onto unregulated technology. It wasn’t until last March that the FCC released its first rules targeting text scammers. In March the agency requested funds from Congress to “facilitate the development of solutions that identify the makers of robocalls,” in next year’s budget, and to “coordinate with international partners and the State Department on diplomatic means and mechanisms to combat unlawful robocalls and robotexts from other countries into the United States. ”Until then, JP Morgan, Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Zelle have partnered with the U. S. Department of Treasury and others on the National Task Force for Fraud & Scam Prevention created by the non-profit Aspen Institute. While most of the work, scheduled to start in September, is focused on education, prevention and detection of scams, part of it is focused on recovery of lost funds and prosecution. Bank of America’s Monaco described the group in his testimony as “an initiative to bring together leading stakeholders from government, law enforcement, private industry, and civil society. ”“Scams and fraud don't originate in Zelle, and scams and fraud aren't unique to Zelle,” says Chance. “They cut across all payment networks. Therefore, the solution to fraud and scam prevention has to be one that focuses across all payment networks, not one isolated payment network. ”This story was originally featured on Fortune. com\n",
      "Amid growing concerns over the handling of customer funds on the popular peer-to-peer payments platform Zelle, the U. S. consumer watchdog is investigating the major banks. The probe, conducted by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”), is primarily focusing on JPMorgan JPM, Bank of America BAC and Wells Fargo WFC, among other large banks, to see how these firms manage fraudulent transactions and customer disputes linked to Zelle. Launched in 2017, the Zelle network aimed to be the go-to alternative to money transfer giants like Venmo and Cash App. It is owned by seven major banks, including JPM, BofA and WFC. Gradually, Zelle became the preferred platform for millions for sending money and handling more transaction volume than Venmo. However, along with growth in the service, there has been an increase in complaints about scams, leaving customers agitated and out of pocket. Thus, the CFPB is particularly concerned about whether these banks act swiftly enough to investigate and resolve disputes when customers claim that they have been deceived. The CFPB is investigating whether banks are doing their job of shutting down accounts controlled by scammers and whether their screening processes for customer identities are thorough enough. Regulators and lawmakers are extremely worried regarding the potential for consumer exploitation on the Zelle platform. Various consumers are left helpless when scams occur, often with little recourse to recover their funds. For almost a year, Zelle has mandated its member banks to reimburse customers for certain disputed transactions, even if the payment was initially authorized by the victim like those involving impersonators claiming to be government officials or bank employees. On their part, these banks have argued that the majority of transfers conducted through Zelle are legitimate. Banks have also emphasized that it is not practically possible to prevent all types of fraud. If the entire cost of such scams is covered, it will encourage more fraud and will ultimately cost billions of dollars for banks. While these technology-driven payments options provide ease to customers, allowing them to transfer money hassle-free, customers are increasingly questioning the safety and reliability of their funds transferred via such platforms, including Zelle. Thus, banks have a huge responsibility to safeguard their customers. Recently, JPMorgan indicated that it has been actively cooperating with the CFPB, and is contemplating the possibility of legal actions against these inquiries. Likewise, Wells Fargo has publicly reported its meetings with regulatory investigations concerning customer dissatisfaction with Zelle. Currently, Bank of America and WFC carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). JPM has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

      "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Undervalued UK Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Carnival Corporation & plc (NYSE:CUK) stands against the other undervalued UK stocks. According to a report by KPMG, the economy of the UK is going through a combination of consumption tailwinds and falling inflation which is expected to support modest positive growth in the country for the remainder of 2024 and in 2025. The United Kingdom’s economy is projected to achieve GDP growth of 0. 5% in 2024, and 0. 9% in 2025, while inflation is expected to hold steady at 2. 6% in both 2024 and 2025. Unemployment rates are also projected to be 4. 5% in 2024 and 4. 9% in 2025. The interest rates are anticipated to drop towards 3% by the end of 2025 and elections are likely to resolve political uncertainty, which would encourage business. However, geopolitical uncertainty, conflicts, and trade tensions could lead to inflation spikes and sharp shifts in monetary policies. Despite the uncertainty, KPMG's analysts remain optimistic about the future. Yael Selfin Vice Chair and Chief Economist at KPMG United Kingdom said:“Global economic prospects are better for 2025, with inflation expected to return towards target and central banks more confident to cut policy rates from the current restrictive levels. The silver lining is a tailwind for big-ticket consumer purchases and business investment. Merger and acquisition activity could also continue to gather steam, as financial conditions ease and dry powder is deployed. However, the uncertainty remains around the political shifts, which could see more insular and protectionist economic policies. ”Investors view the UK market as particularly appealing due to its current valuations, which are similar to those of emerging markets when measured on a forward price-to-earnings basis. The UK equity index stands out for its substantial exposure to the energy sector, which could benefit significantly if the global economy outperforms expectations. Additionally, in times of escalating geopolitical tensions, the energy sector might also see gains, driven by rising prices. The composition of the UK equity market is well-structured, especially in terms of dividend yields and volatility. Compared to European equities, UK stocks are less volatile and offer higher dividend yields, making them an attractive option for investors at this time. Goldman Sachs is also anticipating modest growth in the United Kingdom’s 2025 and 2026 economic growth and forecasts the FTSE 100 Index to rise to 7,900 by the end of 2024. Goldman Sachs said:“Low valuation, improving global demand and low supply aiding commodities stocks, and continued buybacks all support FTSE 100. We do not expect UKX to underperform as it did in 2023,”According to Emma Wall, Head of Investment Analysis at Hargreaves Lansdown, the UK offers one of the best value opportunities among developed markets, particularly for those looking for undervalued investments. Despite its high performance in the FTSE 100, it is highlighted as being on a 45% discount compared to the U. S. market. Emma Wall sees the best value opportunity in the UK, citing the significant discount, international revenues, lack of leverage, and expectations of high dividend payouts as key reasons for this analysis. The UK market presents a unique and compelling opportunity for investors, as the global economy shows signs of improvement and inflation stabilizes, the UK will benefit from economic growth despite some uncertainties, with that in context let’s take a look at the 10 best undervalued UK stocks to buy now. Our MethodologyFor this article, we used the Finviz screener to screen for UK-based companies that are trading at a forward P/E ratio of under 20 as of August 9.

      "We recently compiled a list of the Top 10 Luxury Stocks According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Carnival Corporation & plc (NYSE:CCL) stands against the other luxury stocks. The luxury retail industry is facing significant challenges, with major brands like Burberry, Hugo Boss, and Gucci experiencing substantial drops in their profits. The decline in luxury sales, especially in Asia and the Americas, has been a major concern, with Burberry and Hugo Boss seeing notable decreases in their revenue. Other brands such as Richemont and Swatch have also reported significant downturns in sales, particularly in China. The overall luxury market index has seen a sharp decline, which indicates widespread struggles in the sector. Luxury brands have traditionally relied heavily on Chinese consumers, who have contributed significantly to their growth. However, the slowing Chinese economy and a cautious consumer base have led to reduced spending on luxury goods. The economic slowdown in China is attributed to factors such as lower land sales, an aging population, and decreased exports. Despite the challenges, some brands made significant strides such as the Italian high fashion women's clothing and accessory brand, Miu Miu, which saw a nearly 60% growth last year and a 90% growth in the first quarter of this year. This helped its parent company, Prada Group, increase its sales as well. The luxury market has historically bounced back from downturns, and many in the industry hope that the current challenges are temporary. However, the recent performance has reminded the sector that luxury items are not immune to economic challenges, and consumer demand can fluctuate based on economic conditions and consumer confidence. Nevertheless, luxury brands are comparatively less affected by the economic conditions as most of their purchases are made by a very small group of elite consumers. You can also read our article on Top 11 Luxury Clothing Stocks to Invest in Now, where we discussed luxury consumer behavior in detail. Our MethodologyFor this article, we made a list of nearly 20 luxury stocks with at least Moderate Buy ratings according to analysts and narrowed our list to 10 stocks with the highest average analyst price target, as of August 5. We also added the hedge fund sentiment around each stock which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of over 900 elite hedge funds as of Q1 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

The company acquired the Graduate brand, adding 32 new hotels to its system and four more to its development pipeline. Hilton also welcomed its inaugural NoMad hotel, NoMad London, which has earned a spot on the \"World's 50 Best Hotels\" list. Additionally, the company launched three impressive Portuguese properties: the DUO Hotel Lisbon under the Curio Collection by Hilton, the DoubleTree by Hilton Lagoa Azores and the Legacy Hotel Cascais, also part of the Curio Collection by Hilton. As of Jun 30, 2024, Hilton's development pipeline comprised nearly 3,370 hotels, with almost 508,300 rooms across 136 countries and territories — including 39 countries and regions where it currently has no running hotels. For 2024, the company expects net unit growth in the range of 7-7. 5%. For third-quarter 2024, Hilton anticipates net income in the range of $435-$448 million. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $875 million and $890 million. It projects third-quarter EPS (adjusted for special items) to be between $1. 80 and $1. 85. For third-quarter 2024, management forecasts system-wide RevPAR (on a currency-neutral basis) to increase in the 2-3% band on a year-over-year basis. For 2024, the company estimates net income in the range of $1. 53-$1. 55 billion compared with the previous estimate of $1. 58-$1. 62 billion. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $3. 37 billion and $3. 40 billion compared with the prior expectation of $3. 37 billion and $3. 42 billion. It suggests general and administrative expenses for 2024 in the range of $415-$430 million. Hilton expects 2024 EPS (adjusted for special items) in the range of $6. 93-$7. 03 compared with the previous expectation of $6. 89-$7. 03. Full-year capital return is anticipated to be $3 billion. Management anticipates 2024 system-wide RevPAR (on a currency-neutral basis) to increase 2-3% year over year, down from the prior estimate of 2-4% growth. Hilton currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. Carnival Corporation & plc CCL reported impressive second-quarter fiscal 2024 results, with earnings and revenues beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The top and the bottom line increased on a year-over-year basis. The upside was primarily backed by sustained demand strength and increased booking volumes. The management expects net yields to exceed 10% and drive double-digit returns on invested capital. The quarter’s passenger ticket revenues amounted to $3. 8 billion, up from $3. 1 billion reported in the prior-year quarter. CCL reported strong booking momentum for 2025, with record volumes surpassing 2024 levels in price and occupancy. It reported strength in pricing for the North America, Australia and Europe segments for the third and the fourth quarter of 2024 on a year-over-year basis. The company’s efforts to extend the booking curve and leverage favorable pricing trends resulted in record cumulative bookings for the remainder of 2024, with occupancy rates above 2023 levels. Mattel, Inc. MAT reported mixed second-quarter 2024 results, with earnings surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate and revenues missing the same. The top line missed the consensus estimate for the third straight quarter. The company experienced robust bottom-line performance, propelled mainly by significant gross margin expansion and growth in adjusted EBITDA. MAT is well positioned for the second half with new product innovation and increased retail support. For 2024, management continues to expect net sales to be comparable with the prior year’s levels at cc. It also anticipates 2024 adjusted EPS to be between $1. 35 and $1. 45 compared with $1. 23 in 2023. American Outdoor Brands, Inc. AOUT reported mixed fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 (ended Apr 30, 2024) results. It reported breakeven earnings, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, while net sales topped the same. The top line rose year over year but the bottom line declined. The quarterly results reflected growth in its outdoor lifestyle and shooting sports categories on the back of new product launches across its several brands. The footprint expansion in Canada also bodes well for the company, allowing it to offer outdoor brands to the consumers of Canada. The bottom line was negatively impacted by the amortization of tariff and freight costs, higher promotional product discounts and an immaterial adjustment to a tariff drawback claim submitted in the fiscal 2022.

      "Game-Changing MedallionNet Max WiFi Debuts August 31 Exclusively with Princess Plus and Princess Premier BundlesPrincess to Host First-Ever Land/Sea Custom UGC Competition to Demonstrate Connectivity ExcellenceFT. LAUDERDALE, Fla. , Aug. 7, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Princess Cruises, the world's most iconic cruise brand, today announced the launch of MedallionNet Max, a new level of onboard Wi-Fi service that will meet the growing demands of today's intensively digitally-connected travelers and continue to expand the market for cruise vacations. MedallionNet Max will be available exclusively in Princess Plus and Princess Premier packages. Since 2018, Princess has led the industry on high-performance, onboard Wi-Fi aggressively adopting service new satellite constellations, including a Wi-Fi access point in every stateroom on every ship and ensuring that Wi-Fi service access is simple and hassle-free. Princess is the only cruise operator who has adopted every source of bandwidth spanning the globally deployed fleet including LEO (Starlink), MEO, GEO satellite constellations as well as 5G terrestrial. Princess will now offer two-tiers of Wi-Fi service - MedallionNet Classic and MedallionNet Max. MedallionNet Classic will offer the same service performance, reliability, and global coverage that Princess guests enjoy today. MedallionNet Max will now be the highest performing service tier with prioritized access to the highest quality and highest performance bandwidth available anywhere in the world which is typically Starlink. MedallionNet Max will only be available in the brand's industry-leading bundles – Princess Plus and Princess Premier. These packages are engineered to give guests the maximum experience with the maximum value. A la carte pricing for MedallionNet Classic remains $24. 99 per day for a single device plan and $44. 99 per day for a multi-device plan. Consistent with the cruise brand's relentless focus on personalized and hassle-free service, guests will not have to do anything different onboard to access the different services. The appropriate service level will be assigned based on each guest's package, as indicated on the Princess app. A single guest network will remain, reduce guest confusion related to network names or any complications being added to the onboard experience. To preview the new service tier, Princess Cruises will host the first-ever land/sea custom UGC competition, leveraging a custom Minecraft world - Princess Cruises Nautical Quest. The August 7 match up will feature 32 of the world's most popular UGC players, with eight of the gamers - Shubble, Krinios, Fruitberries, vGumiho, Sneegsnag, JimmyHere, Smajor, and Hannahxxrose - competing aboard Enchanted Princess in the Caribbean against 24 others who will play from home as millions of fans tune in to watch online. \"Just like we did when we launched MedallionNet Classic almost seven years ago, Princess continues to ensure guests have access to highest performing connectivity available at industry leading value,\" said John Padgett, president of Princess Cruises. \"By including MedallionNet Max in our incredible bundles we are guaranteeing the best possible onboard experience with the best value anywhere in the world as our guests explore over 330 destinations via our world-class globally deployed fleet. \"A History of Upping the Connectivity AnteIn early 2018, Princess established a new standard of connectivity for guests on its cruise ships by smashing the bandwidth-at-sea world record with the initial launch of its MedallionNet connectivity service aboard Regal Princess. At a time when the industry average was 10-20 Mbps per ship, Regal Princess reached 2. 25 Gbps, demonstrating there were no practical limits to progressing shipboard connectivity. Since that time, the connectivity landscape has changed dramatically with Starlink, with onboard Wi-Fi increasingly becoming a commodity. However, Princess will continue to ensure connectivity experience differentiation by making it the best value and most hassle-free experience possible. While MedallionNet Max will only be available within the inclusive Princess Plus and Princess Premier bundles, guests opting to sail with the standard Princess vacation package still will be able to purchase MedallionNet Classic connectivity with no change to pricing. In addition to premium connectivity, guests opting for the inclusive Princess Plus and Princess Premier will also enjoy popular amenities like beverages, casual dining, desserts, complimentary room service, fitness classes, crew gratuities and more at an even greater savings of up 65% than when the inclusive package amenities are purchased separately.

      "Carnival Corp. (NYSE: CCL) stock dropped 11% in July, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence. It was negatively affected by overall macroeconomic events and investor sentiment, but there wasn't any news specific to the cruise industry leader. Carnival was a reliable market-beating stock before the pandemic, with steady increases in revenue and profits over many years. It also paid a growing dividend. That all changed when it shut down for the pandemic. But did it really? Carnival's stock tanked when it paused operations, but it's made an incredible comeback. Revenue and demand are at record levels, and profitability is improving. It's likely to look like it used to, or even better, very soon. The one major change on Carnival's financial statements at this point is its high debt. I'm not playing that down; it's a huge issue, and every investor should know about it and understand what it means. Even if a company is making high sales and has happy customers, if it can't pay off its debts, it won't stick around for too long. However, Carnival is the leading global cruise operator, and it's demonstrating strong management skills that are getting it back up to speed. It's generating higher operating cash flow and free cash flow that's outpacing interest on debt, and it's paying off the debt in a deliberate manner, sending off the higher-interest pieces while paying down the principle. There have been mixed indications on Wall Street as to what's going on in the economy, and that's weighing on many stocks, especially ones like Carnival that already come with elevated risk. In general, these key pieces of information wouldn't cause the stock market to soar or tumble, but in these times of turbulence, good news and bad news can send the market to extremes. When they happen almost simultaneously, there's a lot of volatility. Carnival stock had been rising for most of July after a well-received quarterly report in June and signals that the Federal Reserve could cut interest rates in September. But things turned around drastically after a confluence of negative signals, including pressure in the restaurant and retail industries, a higher unemployment rate, and expected pullbacks in consumer spending. All of these factors impact Carnival indirectly, and movements in the stock price are more about fear or confidence than hard data. Carnival stock's drop has continued into August and was exacerbated by the market's free fall Monday morning. It hasn't yet recovered. However, there was mostly good news in its most recent quarterly report. It's going to take more time, but Carnival has excellent prospects and remains a strong long-term pick.

      "Energy Transfer (NYSE: ET) is better known for its hefty cash distributions. The master limited partnership's (MLP) payout currently yields around 8%. That's several times higher than the S&P 500's 1. 5% dividend yield. That high-yielding dividend is only part of the appeal. The MLP is also growing at a brisk pace this year. Because of that, it could have the fuel to produce high-octane total returns. Energy Transfer recently reported robust second-quarter results. The midstream company generated nearly $3. 8 billion of adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) in the period, a 20% surge, compared to the prior year. Meanwhile, its distributable cash flow rocketed 32% to over $2 billion. The MLP delivered strong volumes across its operations, including record-setting results from the following categories: Crude oil transportation (up 23%)Natural gas liquids (NGL) exports (up 3%)NGL transportation volumes (up 4%)NGL and refined products terminal volumes (up 4%) The company benefited from strong market conditions, recently completed expansion projects, and acquisitions. The midstream company closed its $1. 5 billion Lotus Midstream acquisition in May 2023 and its $7. 1 billion merger with Crestwood Equity Partners in November. It also completed its Bear processing plant last June and Frac VII in August of last year. Energy Transfer generated enough cash to cover its distribution by nearly two times ($1. 1 billion of distributions paid to investors in the period). That allowed it to retain all the money needed to fund its growth capital expenses ($549 million) with room to spare and gave it excess cash to help fund its $3. 1 billion acquisition of WTG Midstream, which closed in July. The strong performance of Energy Transfer's base business and its recently closed acquisition of WTG Midstream gave it the confidence to boost its full-year growth outlook. The MLP now expects its adjusted EBITDA to be between $15. 3 billion and $15. 5 billion for the full year (up from its previous range of $15 billion-$15. 3 billion). That's a 12% increase from last year's level at the midpoint. The MLP also increased its growth capital spending outlook. It now expects to invest $3 billion-$3. 2 billion on growth capital projects this year. That's an increase from its prior guidance for capital spending between $2. 8 billion and $3 billion. Fueling that increase are growth capital projects related to its WTG Midstream acquisition and quicker return projects in its crude oil transportation and services segment related to its Crestwood merger. Energy Transfer's backlog features growth capital projects scheduled to come online through the end of 2026. That provides the MLP with lots of visibility into its future growth and helps support its plan to increase its distribution by 3% to 5% per year. Meanwhile, the company has several other projects under development that could further enhance its long-term growth outlook. These include its proposed Lake Charles LNG export project, Blue Marlin Offshore Port, blue ammonia hub, and carbon capture and sequestration projects. Energy Transfer also has the financial flexibility to continue making acquisitions and other investments as opportunities arise. It recently closed its highly accretive acquisition of WTG Midstream. In another accretive deal, the MLP formed a joint venture with Sunoco to combine their crude oil and produced water-gathering assets in the Permian Basin. These moves continue the MLP's strategy of being a leading consolidator in the midstream sector. Energy Transfer is growing briskly these days. The MLP has made several needle-moving acquisitions, which, along with organic expansions, will keep it on track to deliver high-octane growth in the coming quarters. That should give it the fuel to continue increasing its high-yielding distribution. These factors make it a compelling option for those seeking growth and income.

      "Energy Transfer LP showcases robust revenue growth and operating income in its latest 10-Q filing. Strategic acquisitions and joint ventures position ET for expanded market presence and diversification. Environmental liabilities and interest rate risks remain key areas for vigilance. ET's comprehensive infrastructure network and strategic partnerships underline its competitive edge. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Signs with ET. Energy Transfer LP (NYSE:ET), a leading player in the energy sector, released its 10-Q filing on August 8, 2024, revealing a detailed financial and operational overview. The company, known for its extensive network of assets in crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids, reported a significant increase in revenues for both the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023. Total revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2024, were $42,358 million, up from $37,315 million in 2023. Operating income also saw a healthy rise to $4,678 million from $3,897 million. Net income attributable to partners increased to $2,554 million from $2,024 million, with a basic and diluted net income per common unit of $0. 67, up from $0. 58 the previous year. These figures reflect ET's solid financial performance and serve as a foundation for the SWOT analysis that follows. Expansive Asset Portfolio and Revenue Growth: Energy Transfer LP's strength lies in its vast and diversified asset base, which has been a significant driver of its revenue growth. The company's latest financials show a robust increase in revenues across various segments, including refined product sales, crude sales, and NGL sales. This growth is a testament to ET's ability to leverage its assets effectively in a dynamic market. The company's strategic acquisitions, such as the WTG Midstream and Sunoco LP's NuStar, have further bolstered its infrastructure network, enhancing its market reach and service offerings. Operational Efficiency and Profitability: ET's operating income has seen a substantial increase, indicating efficient management and operational excellence. The company's ability to maintain profitability amidst market fluctuations is a testament to its strong business model and cost management strategies. The increase in net income attributable to partners and per common unit further underscores ET's financial health and its ability to generate value for its stakeholders. Environmental Liabilities: Energy Transfer LP's involvement in environmental remediation at various sites, including those related to PCB contamination and hydrocarbon releases, poses a weakness. While the company believes that the reserved amounts for environmental matters are adequate, the potential for unforeseen liabilities remains a concern. Environmental regulations are subject to change, and any future compliance costs could impact ET's financial position. Interest Rate Exposure: With $1. 44 billion of floating rate debt outstanding, ET is exposed to interest rate risk. A hypothetical change of 100 basis points could result in a significant impact on interest expense, potentially affecting the company's profitability. Although ET utilizes interest rate swaps to manage this exposure, the risk associated with variable rate debt instruments cannot be entirely mitigated. Strategic Acquisitions and Joint Ventures: ET's recent acquisitions and joint ventures, such as the WTG Midstream acquisition and the formation of a joint venture in the Permian Basin, present significant opportunities for growth. These strategic moves enable ET to expand its operational footprint, diversify its revenue streams, and enhance its competitive position in the market. The integration of these assets and operations could lead to increased efficiency and market share gains. Market Demand and Infrastructure Expansion: The growing demand for energy and the need for modern infrastructure offer ET opportunities to capitalize on its extensive network and expertise. The company's ability to transport and process energy resources positions it favorably to meet market needs. Continued investment in infrastructure development and expansion projects could further strengthen ET's market presence and revenue potential. Regulatory and Environmental Risks: Energy Transfer LP operates in a highly regulated industry, where changes in environmental laws and regulations can pose significant threats. Increased scrutiny and potential changes in policies could lead to higher compliance costs and operational constraints. Additionally, environmental incidents or non-compliance could result in fines, legal proceedings, and reputational damage. Market Volatility and Counterparty Risks: ET's financial performance is closely tied to the volatile energy market, where fluctuations in commodity prices can impact revenues and profitability. Moreover, the company's exposure to counterparty risks, particularly in derivative transactions, could affect its financial stability. Non-performance by counterparties in derivative contracts could lead to unrealized amounts on ET's balance sheets. In conclusion, Energy Transfer LP's SWOT analysis reveals a company with a strong financial foundation, bolstered by an expansive asset portfolio and strategic growth initiatives. However, it must navigate environmental liabilities, interest rate risks, and regulatory challenges. Opportunities for further expansion and market demand are countered by the threats of market volatility and counterparty risks. ET's forward-looking strategies, including its focus on strategic acquisitions and infrastructure development, will be critical in leveraging its strengths and opportunities while addressing its weaknesses and threats.

      "Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above-average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task. In addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end. However, the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects, makes it pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks. Energy Transfer LP (ET) is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system. In addition to a favorable Growth Score, it carries a top Zacks Rank. Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better. Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this energy-related services provider a great growth pick right now. Arguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration. While the historical EPS growth rate for Energy Transfer LP is 0. 5%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 36. 5% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 6. 7%. Growth investors often overlook asset utilization ratio, also known as sales-to-total-assets (S/TA) ratio, but it is an important feature of a real growth stock. This metric exhibits how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales. Right now, Energy Transfer LP has an S/TA ratio of 0. 74, which means that the company gets $0. 74 in sales for each dollar in assets. Comparing this to the industry average of 0. 69, it can be said that the company is more efficient. While the level of efficiency in generating sales matters a lot, so does the sales growth of a company. And Energy Transfer LP is well positioned from a sales growth perspective too. The company's sales are expected to grow 24. 5% this year versus the industry average of 9. 9%. Beyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements. There have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Energy Transfer LP. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 2. 5% over the past month. While the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Energy Transfer LP a Zacks Rank #2 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. This combination positions Energy Transfer LP well for outperformance, so growth investors may want to bet on it.

      "Investors interested in stocks from the Oil and Gas - Production Pipeline - MLB sector have probably already heard of Energy Transfer LP (ET) and Oneok Inc. (OKE). But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look. Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits. Energy Transfer LP and Oneok Inc. are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #3 (Hold), respectively, right now. This means that ET's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. But this is only part of the picture for value investors. Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels. The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value. ET currently has a forward P/E ratio of 10. 50, while OKE has a forward P/E of 16. 55. We also note that ET has a PEG ratio of 0. 41. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. OKE currently has a PEG ratio of 4. 42. Another notable valuation metric for ET is its P/B ratio of 1. 38. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, OKE has a P/B of 2. 90. These are just a few of the metrics contributing to ET's Value grade of A and OKE's Value grade of C. ET is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook, which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model. And, based on the above valuation metrics, we feel that ET is likely the superior value option right now. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Shares of the U. S. legacy automaker Ford F have tumbled nearly 23% in the past month, primarily due to dismal second-quarter results. Since its latest earnings report on Jul 24, Ford has seen its stock plummet 24. 7% as earnings per share missed expectations, and net income contracted more than 5% year over year to $1. 8 billion. A rise in warranty and vehicle recall expenses hit the automaker’s profits hard. These costs reached a staggering $2. 3 billion in the second quarter alone, up $800 million and $700 million on a sequential and yearly basis, respectively. Ongoing quality issues have been increasing Ford's warranty costs for years, but the massive surge in the second quarter seems to have really spooked investors. In contrast, General Motors GM, Ford’s closest competitor, reported better-than-expected second-quarter earnings and sales and even raised its full-year guidance for EPS and free cash flow (FCF). While Ford did boost its adjusted FCF guidance for 2024, it maintained its profit outlook, which left some investors disappointed, hoping for a more optimistic forecast. As investors weigh Ford's historical resilience against its current setbacks, the question arises whether now is the opportune time to invest in Ford, taking advantage of the recent share price dip. To answer that, let’s delve deeper into the potential drivers and headwinds that could shape the company’s future. Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOne of Ford's brightest spots in the second quarter was its commercial vehicle division, Ford Pro. This segment delivered an impressive operating margin of 15. 1%, the highest among all Ford’s divisions. The robust demand for Super Duty trucks and Transit commercial vans, supported by a healthy order book, drove the segment’s performance. The successful launch of the all-new Super Duty has set a strong foundation for future growth. To capitalize on the rising popularity of Super Duty trucks, Ford recently announced plans to add a third assembly plant in North America, increasing production capacity by 100,000 units starting in 2026. The company has raised the EBIT forecast of Ford-Pro unit from $8-$9 billion to $9-$10 billion amid continued strength across all three domains: vehicles, software and physical services. Ford’s increasing focus on software technology and services business will be a major driver. CEO Jim Farley highlighted on the latest earnings call that Rivian RIVN, Tesla TSLA, and Ford are the only OEMs outside of China with control over software across all vehicle domains. Ford's paid software subscriptions grew 40% in the quarter, reaching more than 765,000, with integrated service revenues set for double-digit growth this year. The company is targeting $1 billion in software revenues next year, with 50%+ gross margins, largely driven by Ford Pro. By 2026, Ford Pro is expected to contribute 20% of the company’s overall EBIT. While Ford Pro has been a strong performer, the company’s electric vehicle (EV) division, Ford Model e, has been a significant drag on overall profits. In the second quarter, the Ford Model e business incurred a loss of $1. 1 billion due to lower sales volumes, pricing pressure and high manufacturing costs. Ford anticipates the full-year loss from the Model e unit to range between $5 billion and $5. 5 billion amid continued pricing pressure and increased investments in next-generation EVs. This underperformance in the EV segment is a critical concern for Ford’s overall profitability. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Ford’s EPS in 2024 is pegged at $1. 90, implying a 5. 5% year-over-year decline. Additionally, earnings estimates for 2024 and 2025 have been revised downward over the past 30 and seven days, indicating a lack of confidence in the company’s near-term prospects. Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchDespite the challenges in the EV segment, Ford Pro’s strong performance is expected to offset some of these losses. However, the company has also reduced its operating profit forecast for the Ford Blue segment, which includes traditional internal combustion engine models, due to ongoing quality issues. Ford’s overall EBIT guidance for 2024 remains within the range of $10-$12 billion. Financially, Ford ended the second quarter with approximately $27 billion in cash and $45 billion in liquidity, an increase from $25 billion in cash and $43 billion in liquidity at the end of the first quarter. The company also remains on track to deliver $2 billion in material, manufacturing, and freight efficiencies over the full year. Additionally, Ford has raised its adjusted FCF projection for the year by $1 billion to a range of $7. 5-$8. 5 billion. However, the road ahead for Ford is far from smooth. Ford needs to improve vehicle quality, reduce complexities, cut warranty and recall costs, and turn around its EV business. The company has indicated that most warranty issues stem from older models and that it is actively improving the quality of its newer models. However, it may take 12 to 18 months before these efforts begin to reduce warranty costs. Unfortunately, this means that Ford could continue to face elevated warranty expenses for some time. Ford’s valuation remains attractive. The company trades at a forward sales multiple of 0. 24, lower than the industry average and its own five-year average, earning it a Value Score of A. Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhile Ford’s valuation is appealing and its Ford Pro division is performing well, the company faces substantial internal challenges. High warranty and recall costs and lower-than-expected EV demand present significant hurdles for the company. Farley and his team face an uphill battle in steering Ford through these challenges, especially as the company works to turn around its struggling Model e division. For new investors, it may be prudent to adopt a wait-and-see approach, while existing shareholders might consider holding onto their shares as the company navigates these headwinds. Ford currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "The stock market's recent sell-off has some investors concerned about their investments and even the overall health of the U. S. economy. But over many people's investing lifetimes, markets will sometimes go up and sometimes go down, and changes can happen rather quickly. If the recent volatility has you looking for more stable investments, consider a few established cash-generating companies that have a long history of dividend payments. Here are three that you can likely buy and hold forever. Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) has one of the richest histories in the automotive industry, but it currently faces numerous challenges. The company is struggling in China. It's working to improve vehicle quality, leading the industry in U. S. recalls for three straight years. And it's losing billions annually with its electric vehicle (EV) division. But those challenges have given investors an opportunity to buy shares of Ford at a price-to-earnings ratio of 10 times, with a dividend yield topping 6. 1% at recent prices. Despite its challenges, Ford has an impeccable balance sheet, with plenty of cash flow thanks to its gasoline-powered trucks, SUVs, and commercial vans. The automaker also has $27 billion in cash with roughly $45 billion in liquidity. That's plenty of capital to invest in long-term growth strategies, and in returning value to shareholders. Ford has committed to returning 40% to 50% of free cash flow to investors. Unlike many companies that do both share buybacks and dividends, Ford will almost certainly deliver those returns purely in dividends. That's because the Ford family owns a separate class of shares that come with 40% voting power as well as the dividend, which is widely known to be loved by the family. For that reason, expect Ford's focus to continue to be on its healthy dividend. Look at the graph below to see the difference in the value of owning Ford shares and reinvesting its dividend, compared to its stock price gains alone. Amid the decline of traditional cigarettes, Altria Group (NYSE: MO) is focused on providing adult smokers with a variety of smoke-free substitutes that include e-vapor, heated tobacco, and oral tobacco. It's a transition that won't be easy or cheap, especially as investors have grown accustomed to the cash cow of cigarettes over the decades, but it's necessary for future growth. Altria already has a wide portfolio of smoke-free products, including NJOY and LLC (which is currently the only e-vapor manufacturer to receive market authorization from the U. S. Food and Drug Administration). Investors shouldn't worry about the decline of cigarettes yet, at least when it comes to the dividend payout. Last year, Altria paid out $6. 8 billion in dividends and spent an additional $1 billion on share repurchases. It still reduced its debt-to-assets ratio, and generated free cash flow of roughly $9 billion to cover everything. While the company is adapting to consumer preference changes, what hasn't changed for Altria Group investors is its staggering dividend yield, recently at 7. 9%. And for investors worried about the U. S. economy, rest assured that Altria's business performs well during downturns, as people purchase tobacco products regardless of economic uncertainty. Altria isn't a growth stock, and it's in the middle of a major transition to smokeless products, but it will remain one of the best dividend stocks for the foreseeable future. Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) has proven to be a strong, consistent, and sustainable business over the decades, and the company continues to evolve. Consider that it has 25 platforms or products that generate over $1 billion in sales annually, and that 65% of its sales come from markets where it's No. 1 or No. 2 globally. Just last year, J&J spun off its consumer health business to focus on medical devices and innovative medicines to increase its growth rate. When it comes to its dividend, the company doesn't play around. It's logged over 60 consecutive years of dividend increases, and over the past five years, it's returned over 60% of its free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks -- its forward dividend yield tops 3%. J&J is focusing on accelerating growth, returns massive value to shareholders, and boasts a diverse portfolio of products, so what's the catch? Currently, the biggest drawback of owning this stock is the uncertainty that comes with lawsuits. In May, J&J announced its third attempt to resolve issues relating to talc-based product lawsuits, and if it can finally put the issue to rest, it'll be a boost to the stock. Long-term, however, investors will still likely be talking about J&J's consistent and increasing dividend in 10 years, and they likely won't be discussing 2024 lawsuits. Ultimately, while all three of these companies face some challenges, investors can rest assured that they can reap the rewards of dividends while they wait for the companies to work through challenges and continue to prosper. Ford, Altria Group, and Johnson & Johnson will continue to provide passive income for years, helping investors sleep more soundly at night even during economic downturns.

      "The automotive industry is evolving rapidly, and it's forcing companies like Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) to adapt on the fly. Just six years ago former Ford CEO, Jim Hackett, made an announcement that Ford would cease all passenger car production in North America other than the prized Mustang. Six years ago it made sense for the folks at the Blue Oval to focus almost entirely on SUVs and trucks, which brought in majority of profits, and leave the low-margin passenger car business to competitors. Fast forward to today. The fundamentals of operating in the electric vehicle industry have flipped that notion on its head, and they are opening the doors for perhaps a new Fiesta, Focus, and Puma. Over the past century, the automotive industry has been relatively simple to understand for investors; the bigger the vehicle, the bigger the margins. Ford's F-150 is its bread and butter and has long hauled in the profits, along with SUVs, and that will continue for internal combustion engine options. However, the complete opposite is true right now for electric vehicles. That's because a much larger SUV or truck requires a much larger electric battery. Ford's CEO, Jim Farley, said that batteries for massive EVs could reach as high as $50,000. Ford has previously said that the data shows, at least currently, that consumers aren't as willing to pay a premium for a larger battery, and that's forced the automaker to adapt. Further, as many analysts predict, EV pricing will need to hit a range between $25,000 and $30,000 to take the next step toward mainstream consumers. It will be difficult for larger vehicles with larger batteries to hit that mark -- at least for now. Now, management believes that the company's future with EVs will largely revolve around small vehicles with less expensive batteries at high volume. That sets the stage for Ford to potentially bring back some of its most popular global models, the Fiesta and/or Focus, which is something management hinted was possible even as the last Fiesta rolled out of production late last year in Europe. Those two models were crucial for Ford's expansion in Europe; just look at the last year of sales before COVID-19 disrupted the industry. A secret bet on affordable EV development was made by Ford years ago, and the \"skunkworks\" team was originally a small team operating independently of Ford's headquarters. But as it became more clear the gamble on developing small EVs was the right decision, the small team has grown to comprise at least 300 members, some from Tesla, Rivian, Apple, and even Formula 1 aerodynamicists. According to a report from Autocar, the new platform could produce successors to the Fiesta and Focus, as well as a replacement for the current Puma crossover which was the best-selling car in the U. K. last year. The good news is that if Ford develops these more affordable EVs based on previous highly popular passenger car models, it's likely to succeed because we've already seen that consumers in the U. S. take to the Chevrolet Bolt EV, Tesla's Model 3, Model Y, and even the Mustang Mach-e. The potential revival of the Fiesta and/or Focus would likely roll out sometime in 2026, and it could be exactly what Ford needs to fend off the competition. 2026 is building up to be a massive year for more affordable EV options with launches of Rivian's R2, Kia's EV3, the next-generation Chevrolet Bolt EV, lower cost Lucid models, and we can only guess how far well-built and highly affordable Chinese EVs will expand globally by that time. While reviving the Fiesta and/or Focus goes against conventional wisdom and is a flip-flop from Ford's previous strategy to axe just about anything that isn't an SUV, truck, or commercial van, the smaller, more affordable models could be key for the Dearborn automaker to turning around its EV division that could lose up to $5. 5 billion in 2024 alone. Stay tuned; Ford's key to the future might just steal a page from its past.

      "The new electric Ford Capri has been one of the most controversial vehicle launches this year. Despite a wholehearted endorsement from the soccer legend Eric Cantona, most feedback about the new car from the BlueOval has been negative. Only some of this is because the Capri update is electric; mostly people don’t like the fact that it’s an SUV. 36Ford Motor's rank on the 2024 Fortune Global 50017Ford Motor's rank on the 2024 Fortune 500This isn’t the first time Ford has taken one of its beloved brands and turned it into an electric SUV. The Mustang Mach-E arrived with great controversy as well. But Ford isn’t the only company focusing on SUVs for its electrification strategy. This is a common theme across most automakers. There are several reasons why so many EVs are SUVs. Developing a car with a new drivetrain such as an all-electric vehicle costs a lot, and SUVs tend to command a price premium, enabling some recoup of that investment. It’s also much easier to hide the weight gain from the huge battery pack required to provide a decent range inside the SUV format than in a compact hatchback. Then there’s the popularity factor. Automakers want to shift cars, obviously, so they will go for formats that sell well. According to JATO Dynamics, SUVs had 51. 1% of the European market in April 2024. The U. S. market is even better, with SUVs gaining 53. 5% of U. S. car sales in 2022. From this perspective, automakers are simply giving people what they want. It’s worth underlining where the popularity of SUVs came from, however. In the 1970s, the first U. S. auto pollution regulations were drawn up. At that time the only people driving heavy vehicles like trucks had commercial purposes, so the fuel efficiency rules for them were more lenient. Automakers spotted this loophole, created a consumer vehicle that was also a truck, and the gas-guzzling SUV was born. Consumers ended up loving these large, spacious vehicles despite their lack of fuel economy. This is also despite the fact that vehicles with a hood height more than 40 inches are 45% more likely to cause fatalities in pedestrian crashes, and are more likely to roll over in an accident due to high center of gravity while inflicting more severe injuries because of their weight. SUVs had 51. 1% of the European market in April 2024. According to JATO Dynamics. This penchant has been carried forward to electrification, which brings us back to the Ford Capri. If you were born long enough ago to remember the original car in its heyday, the new electric SUV version doesn’t have a lot to do with that. It’s not a two-door 2+2 fastback. It’s not even meant to be that sporty. “Clearly, it doesn't look like the last Capri that left the production line in the 80s,” says Pete Zillig, Marketing Director, Ford. “We're really cognizant of the fact that this is primarily aimed at young urban families. We talk about the car you always promised yourself. Some of those people won't even know the Capri nameplate, because they are too young to remember. ”“The world is moving on,” adds Amko Leenarts, Design Director, Ford. “This car would never have been as good as it is now if we hadn’t have the Capri as our main inspiration. ” However, Zillig argues: “We didn’t just electrify the last Capri that left the production line in the 80s. We brought the spirit of the Capri with us into 2024. Of course, we'll have the haters, you always get the haters. But the acceptance research that we did for this vehicle was incredibly positive. ”“This car would never have been as good as it is now if we hadn’t have the Capri as our main inspiration. ”Amko Leenarts, Design Director, Ford. The negative online reaction doesn’t necessarily mean the Capri is going to fail. This will be more a factor of how good the car is, despite the Capri branding. Press drives haven’t been provided yet, but the Capri has the same Volkswagen Group-derived electric drivetrain as the Ford Explorer, which is reasonably quick, good to drive, and has decent range. But the Capri is not just a different body on top of the same underlying car. Did you see it? The Legend Is Back. The New All-Electric Ford Capri. https://t. co/Mm2EJ1TfSs #LegendIsBack #JeSuisCapri #FordCapri pic. twitter. com/SB9F6l9gaX— Ford UK (@forduk) July 10, 2024“The Capri is slightly longer and is 10 millimeters lower on the wheels,” says Leenarts. “There's a bit of tuning on the steering, braking, and suspension. Considering how well the Explorer EV was perceived as still feeling like a Ford, I'm expecting the same on this one. ” From first impressions, it seems like a well-thought-out car, with plenty of interior passenger and luggage space despite the “coupe” fastback design. “It will have a bit more range than the Explorer – 630km (393 miles) – because even though it’s slightly heavier, the aero is better. ”“With the Explorer, once people got behind the wheel and drove it, they were totally convinced it's an amazing vehicle and drives like a Ford,” says Zellig. “The Capri is more of a sports coupe, with different aerodynamics, a different look and feel. We want to make electric iconic and bring the love back to the brand. ”However, the new car didn’t necessarily need to be called “Capri” to have these design characteristics, although Zellig reckons it still has the original car’s spirit, claiming: \"Capri was ahead of its time but even back then we talked about it being a sporty vehicle that had great utility. We didn't even have the term SUV then. ” Leenarts adds: “We still combine practicality with positivity which was what the old Capri was famous for. But we're not going to do a two door - that doesn't make sense. ”With the advent of the Capri, Ford now has three electric SUVs in its range, which could arguably cannibalize each other’s sales. Leenarts doesn’t think this will happen, however. “I don't think we're going to compete with ourselves,” he says. “Traditionally, 10 centimeters more physical length defines a segment. ” This was an area Ford stressed when it launched the Explorer – that it’s shorter than vehicles that use the same platform such as the Volkswagen ID. 4 or Skoda Enyaq iV. The Mustang Mach-E is 474cm long, the Explorer EV 446cm, and the Capri 463cm, so they are different lengths. With the advent of the Capri, Ford now has three electric SUVs in its range, which could arguably cannibalize each other’s sales. “It's about size and capability,” says Leenarts. “If people want a car that they can more easily park in the city, an Explorer is probably the one to go for. It’s the Capri if people are looking for something that is more premium. More performance means the Mach-E GT. ”However, Ford’s next EV will be yet another SUV—an all-electric version of the Puma, which will allegedly be cheaper than the current Explorer, Mustang Mach-E or Capri, but still more expensive than the outgoing combustion-based Puma. This underlines the fundamental problem with the focus on electric SUVs—how much they cost. There has been a lot of mainstream press attention given to a softening of the EV market, although some of this appears to be inspired more by the wishes of some manufacturers than facts. The European EV market was still up 2% in the first half of 2024, while the latest July figures for the U. K. from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders gave EVs a 16. 8% share year-to-date, up 10. 5% from last year. However, EVs were only 8% of the US market in Q2 2024, a little down from 8. 1% in Q4 2023. Either way, it’s not true that “nobody wants EVs” as some haters say (usually due to a vested interest in combustion-based cars). But there is a softening of the market in some regions, and sales haven’t accelerated as fast as some predicted. A big part of this is because of the focus on premium SUVs. For greater mass appeal, cheaper electric cars are needed. In Europe, the Dacia Spring is a step in the right direction. It’s flimsily put together, but the range is usable, it can seat five at a pinch with some bags in the back, and it’s just about okay to drive. However, despite coming from a Romanian car brand owned by France’s Renault Group, the Spring is made in China. And therein lies the rub. European manufacturers (and American ones like Ford) can’t make cheap EVs like the Chinese can. America has protected itself from this with a 100% tariff on imported Chinese cars. The EU has added 17. 4% to 37. 6% on top of the existing 10% tax. But these are clearly more an admission of local inability to compete, and part of that is the focus on premium SUVs. “The world has been looking for more practicality,” says Leenarts. “People want to travel comfortably. ” However, once early adopters have made their purchase, the world also wants EVs that don’t cost a considerable premium. Maybe building some electric cars that aren’t SUVs would make this easier to achieve. This story was originally featured on Fortune. com\n",
      "We recently compiled a list of the 7 Best EV Stocks Under $50. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) stands against the other EV stocks under $50. Since 2018, electric vehicle (EV) sales have been rapidly growing as the world tries to reach its carbon neutrality goal by 2050. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), only 2% of new vehicles registered globally were electric vehicles, and reached 18% by the end of 2023. Even though most of these sales were concentrated in China, Europe, and the US, other markets such as India, Thailand, Vietnam, and Latin America have also been adopting the EV trend at a fast pace. In 2024, while the high costs due to interest rates stalled EV sales a little, they are still growing at a significant pace as the sales reached 3. 4 million units in Q1, compared to 2. 6 million in the first quarter of 2023, according to the IEA. Furthermore, the accounting and consulting firm, PwC analyzed 21 markets and found out that in the second quarter of 2024, 37% of vehicles sold in these markets were battery-electric vehicles (BEVs), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), or hybrids, marking an increase from 30% in the same period of 2023. At the same time, overall EV sales rose by 21% compared to Q2 2023, while sales of internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles declined by 9% during the same period. BloombergNEF's Long-Term Electric Vehicle Outlook shows that as technology improves and battery prices drop, EV adoption is increasingly driven by consumer demand. Passenger EV sales are expected to surpass 30 million units in 2027 and reach 73 million units by 2040. Despite such progress, strong policy support is still needed, as only 69% of the global car fleet is expected to be electrified by 2050 in the base case scenario, short of the 100% target in the Net Zero scenario. Heavy trucks and other segments lag in reaching net zero and full combustion vehicle sales need to stop by 2038 to reach the goal. The report states that the global EV market could reach $63 trillion by 2050, with significant investment needed in battery production and charging infrastructure. According to estimates by Fortune Business Insights, the global EV market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 13. 8% from 2024 to 2032, and Asia is currently the dominant region with a 51. 24% market share. This is the time for investors to take positions in EV stocks, as the EV market is just getting started and is poised for a lot of growth.

      "Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC) stock has been battered and beaten this month, and August has only just begun. The company's share price has plunged 34% since July 30 amid a sell-off affecting countless stocks. Growing fears of a recession and dismal earnings from Intel sent investors into a panic. While I firmly believe in holding through a market dip rather than selling a tech stock like Intel, it doesn't necessarily mean now is the time to buy more. The above chart shows that despite recent declines, Intel's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is significantly higher than other tech stocks. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) offer similar exposure to budding markets like artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing yet are trading at a better value than Intel. In addition to Intel's stock being poorly valued, its latest quarter (the second quarter of 2024) missed revenue and earnings-per-share (EPS) expectations. Meanwhile, recent earnings from AMD and Alphabet illustrate a positive growth trajectory. So forget Intel and consider buying these two millionaire-maker stocks instead. AMD's stock has tumbled 24% over the last month as tech stocks have fallen out of favor. However, the company boasts a long history of growth that has seen it create many millionaires, with its share price up more than 3,000% since 2014. The company has enjoyed immense success over the years, taking on a crucial role in the chip market. AMD's hardware powers products across tech, from game consoles like Sony's PlayStation 5 to consumer-built PCs, laptops, data centers, and AI models. As a result, AMD is easily one of the best stocks to gain exposure to different areas of tech. AMD's closest competitors are Nvidia and Intel, and the three companies are fierce rivals in AI chips. Nvidia dominates the industry, while Intel has yet to make real headway. However, recent earnings indicate AMD's AI division is on a promising growth path and gaining on Nvidia. In Q2 2024, AMD's revenue rose 9% year over year, beating expectations by $120 million. Meanwhile, earnings per share of $0. 69 outperformed estimates by $0. 01. The quarter benefited from a 115% year-over-year revenue increase in its AI-focused data center segment and a 49% rise in client sales. AMD's gaming segment suffered from reductions in semi-custom chip sales, with revenue falling 59%. However, that didn't stop solid growth in the quarter as the company pivoted its business toward AI. Operating income for the period hit $269 million, significantly improving on the $20 million in losses reported a year ago. AMD's Q2 2024 proves it's enjoying impressive returns on its hefty investment in AI and gaining in the industry. Its quarterly free cash flow has soared 81% year to date, increasing its spending power. In addition to being a better-valued stock, AMD is a no-brainer buy over Intel right now. Alphabet's share price has tumbled 17% since early July, in tandem with the tech sell-off. However, its forward P/E of 21 makes it one of the best-valued stocks in tech and too good to pass up. Meanwhile, like AMD, recent earnings hint at a lucrative future for the tech giant. The Google company reported its Q2 2024 earnings at the end of July, with revenue rising 14% year over year to $85 billion. The quarter saw solid growth in advertising, with sales increasing by 11%. However, Google Cloud delivered the most gains, with revenue soaring 28% year over year and beating competitors Amazon Web Services and Microsoft in cloud growth for the period. At the start of the year, Alphabet seemed to fall behind its cloud rivals, but earnings prove it's quickly catching up. In addition to impressive revenue growth, Google Cloud's operating income nearly tripled and hit more than $1 billion for the first time. Success in cloud computing is promising for Alphabet as it diversifies its earnings, allowing it to lean less on advertising and secure a promising role in AI. Alphabet has a long history of making people rich and undoubtedly created more than a few millionaires, with its stock up 470% over the last decade. With its bargain price, Alphabet's stock is worth picking up over Intel and is an excellent way to invest in tech.

      "Investing. com -- Here are the biggest analyst moves in the area of artificial intelligence (AI) for this week. InvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today!New Street Research has upgraded NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) to a Buy rating with a target price of $120 this week. The move comes following a significant decline in the chipmaker’s stock since its June peak, leading Nvidia to underperform other semiconductor stocks linked to data center AI. “We find the correction healthy overall, recognize some limited and tactical headwinds specific to Nvidia, but overall see the stock moves as an opportunity to gain more exposure,” analysts said. The recent dip in Nvidia's shares has been partially attributed to reports of a potential three-month delay in the release of its Blackwell chip due to design flaws. This delay could push volume shipments to Q1 2025. Blackwell’s design features two large dies interconnected at 10TB/s using TSMC’s CoWoS-L packaging technology, which has faced ramp-up challenges and may require redesign. To address this delay, Nvidia might extend the lifecycle of its Hopper chip, which uses the more mature CoWoS-S packaging and can be produced more efficiently. Also, Nvidia could introduce a simplified version of the Blackwell chip with a single die, New Street explains. “While it would have lower performance than the dual-die Blackwell SKUs, it would still be an uplift vs. Hopper,” analysts noted. New Street also maintains a positive outlook on Nvidia’s market dominance in the data center XPU space. \"We see in-house XPUs doing well against GPUs and being deployed in millions across gigantic in-house captive markets,\" though they acknowledge AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) as a potential challenger. Moreover, expectations for hyperscaler capex in 2025 have risen, now forecasting 13% growth, with AI infrastructure capex projected to grow by at least 30%. This supports the firm’s forecast that AI semiconductor spending could increase by 50% annually. Mizuho analysts on Wednesday downgraded Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) stock from Outperform to Neutral and adjusted their price target to $22 from $36. The investment bank initially upgraded Intel in November 2023, driven by expectations of strong AI momentum and new products boosting PC and data center traction. However, nine months later, the outlook has changed. \"We were wrong—INTC has continued to lag its peers and is losing share in all key markets AI/DC/PC through 2025E,” analysts wrote. “We see INTC headwinds continuing, with execution risks on its product portfolio, and we're downgrading INTC to Neutral. \"The technology gap between Intel and its competitors has widened, and while there is long-term potential for foundry and 18A tailwinds, regaining lost leadership is likely to be challenging, Mizuho notes. Despite launching new products in Server (Sierra Forest/Granite Rapids), AI (Gaudi 3), and PC (Meteor Lake), Intel is losing market share in PCs and data centers, remains “a distant 3rd in merchant AI. ” Mizuho also cited internal challenges, including headcount reductions that could impact morale and execution. The decision to cut dividends has further weighed on investor sentiment toward the stock, analysts pointed out. Earlier in the week, Bank of America analysts cut their rating on Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) stock to Neutral from Buy following the company's report of worse-than-expected margins for the fiscal fourth quarter. Although Q4 revenue met both the firm's and street estimates, the gross margin of 11. 3% fell significantly short of the anticipated 13. 6%. SMCI stock fell 20% on Wednesday. The data center company's revenue guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 exceeded expectations, and its full fiscal 2025 revenue projection of $28 billion topped the consensus estimate of $23. 8 billion. However, BofA noted that Super Micro's gross margin is expected to gradually return to its typical range of 14-17% by the end of fiscal 2025, assuming improvements in manufacturing efficiencies, a better customer mix, and the launch of new platforms. “While the long-term benefit from AI remains intact, we move to a Neutral rating, from Buy, as we see the next several quarters remaining margin challenged as SMCI navigates a competitive pricing environment, delayed shipment of Blackwell GPU systems that require liquid-cooled racks (higher margin), and ongoing issues with component availability. ”Reflecting these headwinds, they also lowered their price objective for Super Micro Computer from $1,090 to $700, aligning with the broader sector trend where valuation multiples have seen a notable decline. Palantir (NYSE:PLTR) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) have announced a partnership this week to develop an integrated technology suite designed for the U. S. Defense and Intelligence Community. This collaboration will leverage Palantir's AI-powered platforms within Microsoft's government and classified clouds, enabling secure cloud, AI, and analytics capabilities. As part of the agreement, Palantir will deploy its full product suite, including Foundry, Gotham, Apollo, and AIP, on Microsoft's cloud platforms. This will allow government agencies to build AI tools for operational and logistical purposes, with hands-on experiences to test the technology. Also, Palantir will integrate Microsoft's Azure OpenAI Service into secure environments, combining cloud computing with advanced language models to support AI-driven operations in defense and intelligence. “With this marquee deal solidified and MSFT leveraging PLTR for AI and LLM capabilities to the US government, the company can now increase the pace of AI implementation while PLTR continues to accelerate AIP adoption within the federal sector,” Wedbush analysts commented. “We believe this will be a launching pad for the PLTR AIP story to hit the DOD (Department of Defense) and broader Beltway ecosystem over the next 12 to 18 months,” they added. Semiconductor stocks have seen a sharp decline recently, driven by macroeconomic challenges and disappointing earnings that fell short of high expectations. The downturn has been linked to slower-than-anticipated replenishment of analog inventories and potential risks from the automotive sector, which accounts for 14% of semiconductor demand. However, analysts at Citi remain optimistic about the sector, stressing that \"the main reasons we are positive – AI and memory strength – remain intact. \"Despite the recent drop, Citi continues to favor Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) as their top pick within the industry. They believe that \"it’s time to double down as the DRAM upturn should persist given reduced capacity and DRAM pricing in 3Q24 is better than expected. \"The DRAM market is showing signs of improvement, with strong performances from major players like Samsung (KS:005930) and SK Hynix. Citi analysts have revised their forecast for 2024 DRAM pricing, now expecting a 62% year-over-year increase, up from their previous estimate of 53%. This adjustment is attributed to limited supply growth and a shift by memory makers towards high-bandwidth memory (HBM). While there are weaknesses in the automotive and industrial sectors, the demand from the largest end markets – PCs, handsets, and servers, which collectively represent 61% of semiconductor demand – remains relatively strong. Micron has reported that inventory levels in the traditional data center market improved during the first half of 2024 and anticipates further growth in the second half. Citi analysts have also indicated that they \"expect upside to guidance when Micron reports earnings in September. ”Micron saw its shares slump more than 30% over the past month.

      "There's no denying Nvidia has been the centerpiece of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution thus far. Its technology is used in the vast majority of the world's AI platforms simply because it offers the most computing power. And Nvidia shares have performed accordingly since the movement got going in earnest early last year. As is the case with any other industry, however, time is driving changes on the AI front. Nvidia is no longer the market's top opportunity. This title is shifting toward Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE: TSM), which is arguably better positioned to capitalize on the next chapter of AI's growth story. Nvidia isn't doomed. But it would be naïve to not recognize that most of AI's easy money has already been made. Competition is heating up. Intel and Advanced Micro Devices are stepping up their games. Price wars are underway. There's an often overlooked but important detail about the AI hardware business you must understand, however. That is, chipmakers like the aforementioned Nvidia and AMD usually don't manufacture their own chips. They typically outsource such work to third-party \"contract\" manufacturers that are capable of fabricating this silicon to its designers' specifications. Taiwan Semiconductor is one of these contract manufacturers. Indeed, it's the biggest name in the business. It's estimated to manufacture on the order of two-thirds of the world's semiconductors and associated circuitry, and an even greater share when just looking at the planet's high-performance chip market. This might help drive the point home: Advanced Micro Devices as well as Nvidia are both confirmed customers of Taiwan Semiconductor. Intel continues to invest in the construction of its own foundries, although it's forged a developmental partnership with Taiwan Semiconductor to do so. Connect the dots. Taiwan Semiconductor may actually be the technological heart and soul of the global AI revolution. And it's not limited to data centers. As time marches on, AI computing work is making its way toward end users, and end users' mobile phones in particular. Apple's newest processor -- the A17 found in the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max -- is capable of handling generative AI tasks on the device itself rather than in the cloud, where most generative AI work is presently done. It's not just Apple wading into on-device artificial intelligence waters, either. Qualcomm's newest high-performance Snapdragon 8 (Gen 3) mobile processors can handle the same kind of load on mobile devices. Apple as well as Qualcomm both also utilize Taiwan Semiconductor's chip-manufacturing services. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing doesn't make every chip used by the aforementioned outfits, for the record, nor does it manufacture every AI chip the world's currently using or will use in the future. It's likely losing market share as other players ramp up their capacity to crank this silicon out, in fact. Intel in particular is showing the potential to become a serious competitor to Taiwan Semiconductor. There's still more upside here than not, however, despite the prospect of shrinking market share. Market research outfit Skyquest suggests the artificial intelligence hardware market is set to grow at an annualized pace of 15. 5% through 2031, while the mobile AI market is likely to grow at a compound yearly rate of nearly 27% for the same time frame. In this vein, the analyst community believes Taiwan Semiconductor's top line is set to nearly double between last year and 2026, as the AI chipmaking industry gels. So why is this stock down more than 20% just since its July peak (with many other artificial intelligence names down similarly)? That's got more to do with the market environment than anything else. Investors finally began realizing last month that a few too many stocks had reached too-frothy valuations. The disappointing jobs report for July released on Friday of last week didn't help either, leading the crowd to presume lingering economic weakness is on the horizon. And maybe it is. Don't lose perspective, though. Even in a tough economic environment most chip brands are still going to need new silicon. And most of them are still in no position to make much (if any) of it themselves. They'll still need Taiwan Semiconductor to make it for them. Indeed, economic weakness might even stifle capital expenditures on new foundries, making a proven, cost-effective foundry like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing all the more important to the AI business's biggest players.

      "Tech stocks have taken a deep dive, with the Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector down 10% in just five days. Fears of a recession triggered a major sell-off, with seven of the most valuable tech companies losing a combined $1 trillion in market value on Aug. 5. As a result, now is an excellent time to bulk up your portfolio with companies active in lucrative fields like artificial intelligence (AI). Despite the market downturn, AI remains a sector with massive growth potential. Data from Grand View Research shows the market hit $197 billion last year. Yet, that figure is expected to reach nearly $2 trillion by the end of the decade, expanding at a compound annual rate of 37%. In terms of the companies powering much of the industry, it's hard to go wrong with chip stocks. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) are compelling options, especially after a sell-off. Nvidia designs the chips used by the majority of AI developers. Intel is building the world's largest AI chip plant in Ohio as it seeks to retake a position as a top manufacturer. So, let's take a deep dive into these chipmakers' businesses and determine whether Nvidia or Intel is the better AI stock to invest in. Nvidia's stock has dipped 10% since July 30 as Wall Street has cooled on tech stocks. However, past trends suggest the company won't be down for long, and it could be worth buying the dip. The company's stock plunged 50% amid an economic downturn in 2022, fueled by significant spikes in inflation and reduced spending across multiple markets. Yet, macroeconomic improvements and a boom in AI have seen the share price skyrocket 586% since then, alongside soaring earnings. Nvidia's revenue, operating income, and free cash flow have hit new heights over the last year, making the recent sell-off look like an overreaction. The current economy is night-and-day different from what it was in 2022, or even 2008, for that matter. Many tech companies are growing and have posted multiple quarters of encouraging results. Meanwhile, Nvidia is at the top of its AI game, responsible for 80% of the AI graphics processing units (GPUs). The company got a head start in the industry over rivals like AMD and Intel, which allowed it to expand its brand power. Millions of developers have grown so accustomed to Nvidia's CUDA development software accompanying its AI GPUs that many are hesitant to switch to a rival product. As a result, the company has retained its AI dominance even while its competitors have debuted similar offerings at lower prices. With solid earnings and significant market share, Nvidia is an attractive investment after a sell-off. Intel's stock price has plummeted 34% in the last five days, its worst drop in decades. Declines were spurred by economic fears and exaggerated by poor quarterly results. The company posted its second-quarter earnings on Aug. 1. Revenue fell 1% year over year, missing forecasts by $150 million. Meanwhile, earnings per share of $0. 02 fell short of expectations by $0. 08. Poor earnings reflect Intel's hefty investment in restructuring, shifting to a foundry model, and placing a larger emphasis on AI. The company is focusing on the big picture and long-term rewards, suggesting investors should do the same. Since last year, Intel has made some major changes, unveiling multiple new AI-enabled chips and beginning construction on the first of at least four chip factories in the U. S. Neither of these ventures come cheap, as reflected in its second-quarter losses. However, they could pay off over the next five to ten years. CEO Pat Gelsinger said in a recent earnings call that increased production on its AI-capable Core Ultra PC chips contributed to poor earnings. But he added that \"the AI PC will grow from less than 10% of the market today to greater than 50% in 2026,\" suggesting it is likely to make up for those losses. The company is taking a similar approach to manufacturing. Intel has invested billions into opening chip fabs throughout the U. S. as it seeks to become the country's leading AI chip manufacturer. It'll take time, but it could be worth buying the stock cheaply now to hold over the long term. Nvidia and Intel are at vastly different stages of their AI journeys, with one dominating the industry and the other yet to see a return on its investments. Considering their valuations, neither is a huge bargain. But Nvidia's stock is a better value, with a lower price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Meanwhile, its P/E is close to its 10-year average for the metric, while Intel's is far higher than its average. Intel could be a smart long-term play, but its dismal earnings and a high valuation make Nvidia a more attractive buy right now. Nvidia has an established position in AI and consistent earnings, making it too good to pass up.

Example: If one decision had gone the other way, chipmaker Intel today might be on the leading edge of AI rather than struggling to regain its onetime industry leadership. In 2017 and 2018 the company had a chance to buy a 15% stake in OpenAI for $1 billion, Reuters recently reported. If CEO Bob Swan had said yes, that investment would now be worth an estimated $12 billion, based on a February evaluation of OpenAI by venture capitalists and private investors. But Intel missed much more. It reportedly might have received an additional 15% in return for selling hardware to OpenAI at cost. With 30% ownership it could have been at the forefront of generative AI, which OpenAI released to the world in 2022. From the vantage point of 2017 and 2018, however, Swan judged the potential deal a loser. (Swan did not respond to Reuters’s request for comment. )The episode recalls a similar decision, in 2006, when Apple CEO Steve Jobs asked Intel CEO Paul Otellini to make chips for a product that didn’t yet exist, which would be called the iPhone. Otellini said no. When he retired in 2013, he seemed to grasp the magnitude of his decision, telling an interviewer, “The world would have been a lot different if we’d done it. ” (You can read the full story about the fallout from that decision here. )Intel now tests the longtime observation that a company can survive a wrong CEO, but no company can survive four consecutive wrong CEOs. After Intel’s great CEO Andy Grove stepped down in 1998, he was followed by four CEOs, including Swan and Otellini, who were arguably wrong for the job at that time. As performance deteriorated, the directors in 2021 brought in former Intel chief technology officer Pat Gelsinger as CEO to lead an ambitious high-stakes rescue mission. The outcome remains unclear; Intel’s stock price recently plunged 26% on poor quarterly results. The Intel saga is a grim reminder that some of America’s greatest companies have succumbed to the four-wrong-CEOs disease. Consider Westinghouse, a jewel of American industry for 100 years. Four consecutive wrong CEOs from 1983 to 1993 damaged Westinghouse so grievously that the board brought in an outsider CEO who disassembled and re-created the company. An entity called Westinghouse remained, but the awesome institution was gone, and the new-look company has since disintegrated. Even more dramatic was the demise of Sears, the world’s largest retailer for decades. Four wrong CEOs from 1962 to 1986 led Sears onto a downward trajectory from which it couldn’t recover. Under the first of those CEOs, Sears’ market value reached its apex and began to decline, a reversal the top leaders explained away as a quirk of the economy. Under the fourth, Sears diversified heavily into financial services and demoted the retail business to a cash cow to be milked until it stopped. The financial services strategy failed and was unwound in 1992, but by then Walmart had surpassed Sears, which had lost its momentum forever. Investor Eddie Lampert bought the company in 2004 but couldn’t revive it. Sears once had 3,500 stores. Now it has 11. It’s worth asking why corporate doom often takes four CEOs. Surely just one really terrible boss could do the job, right? Yes, but in companies of significant size, truly awful CEOs will probably be pushed out before they can destroy the whole thing. Ruining a substantial, successful business takes some doing, as explained by Jim Collins, author of multiple business mega-sellers (Built to Last, Good to Great, Great by Choice). In How the Mighty Fall, he identifies five stages of decline: hubris borne of success; undisciplined pursuit of more; denial of risk and peril; grasping for salvation; capitulation to irrelevance or death. Intellectually and emotionally, a single CEO would have a tough time going through all five stages, and a board could scarcely let one CEO take a company through all five. To see how those stages play out, and why even three wrong CEOs might not be enough to wreck a company, examine Apple’s situation in 1997. The company was 20 years old. Three consecutive wrong CEOs had taken the company through the first three stages of decline. The company had been close to bankruptcy and was now in the fourth stage, grasping for salvation. A wrong fourth CEO would almost surely have taken Apple to the final stage. The board of directors, desperate, brought back co-founder Steve Jobs, who had been fired in 1985 and (believe it or not) had never been Apple’s CEO. The rest is history, but it could so easily have gone the other way. It must be said that wrong CEOs are not dim-witted or evil. Most often they’re intelligent, highly accomplished, and motivated to succeed, but experience or temperament unsuited them for the job in that company at that time. Four of them in a row is as unlikely as four of a kind in poker, but in the corporate world it doesn’t happen by chance. Ultimately blame must fall on those fallible humans in the board room.

      "Lucid Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:LCID) shareholders are probably feeling a little disappointed, since its shares fell 3. 7% to US$3. 15 in the week after its latest second-quarter results. The results don't look great, especially considering that statutory losses grew 15% toUS$0. 34 per share. Revenues of US$200,581,000 did beat expectations by 4. 1%, but it looks like a bit of a cold comfort. The analysts typically update their forecasts at each earnings report, and we can judge from their estimates whether their view of the company has changed or if there are any new concerns to be aware of. With this in mind, we've gathered the latest statutory forecasts to see what the analysts are expecting for next year. See our latest analysis for Lucid Group Taking into account the latest results, the current consensus from Lucid Group's 13 analysts is for revenues of US$760. 5m in 2024. This would reflect a meaningful 14% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months. Losses are expected to increase slightly, to US$1. 23 per share. Yet prior to the latest earnings, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$749. 0m and losses of US$1. 13 per share in 2024. Overall it looks as though the analysts were a bit mixed on the latest consensus updates. Although revenue forecasts held steady, the consensus also made a modest increase to its losses per share forecasts. The consensus price target held steady at US$3. 17, seemingly implying that the higher forecast losses are not expected to have a long term impact on the company's valuation. Fixating on a single price target can be unwise though, since the consensus target is effectively the average of analyst price targets. As a result, some investors like to look at the range of estimates to see if there are any diverging opinions on the company's valuation. Currently, the most bullish analyst values Lucid Group at US$4. 00 per share, while the most bearish prices it at US$1. 75. This is a fairly broad spread of estimates, suggesting that analysts are forecasting a wide range of possible outcomes for the business. Looking at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can make sense of these forecasts is to see how they measure up against both past performance and industry growth estimates. It's pretty clear that there is an expectation that Lucid Group's revenue growth will slow down substantially, with revenues to the end of 2024 expected to display 30% growth on an annualised basis. This is compared to a historical growth rate of 68% over the past three years. Juxtapose this against the other companies in the industry with analyst coverage, which are forecast to grow their revenues (in aggregate) 13% per year. So it's pretty clear that, while Lucid Group's revenue growth is expected to slow, it's still expected to grow faster than the industry itself. The most important thing to note is the forecast of increased losses next year, suggesting all may not be well at Lucid Group. Happily, there were no major changes to revenue forecasts, with the business still expected to grow faster than the wider industry. The consensus price target held steady at US$3. 17, with the latest estimates not enough to have an impact on their price targets. With that said, the long-term trajectory of the company's earnings is a lot more important than next year. At Simply Wall St, we have a full range of analyst estimates for Lucid Group going out to 2026, and you can see them free on our platform here. .

      "On today's episode of Catalysts, Hosts Seana Smith and Madison Mills break down some of the trading day's biggest stories, from the global market sell-off to some of the latest earnings reports. The major indexes (^DJI,^GSPC, ^IXIC) are bouncing back after a three-day sell-off triggered by a weaker-than-expected jobs report in July. As investors continue to be wary of a recession, Apollo Global Management chief economist Torsten Slok notes that despite the weak labor report, there's not much other evidence that points to a recession: \"Daily data for how many people fly on airplanes as of last Friday is still strong. Daily data from OpenTable for how many people go to restaurants is still strong. Weekly data for retail sales from Redbook is also still strong. Hotel occupancy rates, the weekly data also still strong. \"He reiterates Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's emphasis on the totality of the data, and adds, \"the market is overreacting to just one data point. \" Note: Apollo Global Management is Yahoo's parent company. Longview Economics founder, CEO, and chief market strategist Chris Watling explains, \"Sell-offs tend to happen in waves. So it's not just a straight line down, then we're done. You know, they tend to be three waves or five waves. And in the middle of that, you get these relief rallies. So it's perfectly natural that you have a very aggressive downside, a little bit of short covering, which creates a rally, which is probably what we're in now. \" For investors trying to navigate the pullback, he encourages them to \"buy the bounce, trade them for a couple of weeks, go long if you're nimble, but really lighten up if you're if you're sort of multi-month investor. It all depends on your time frames. That's the challenge. \"A federal judge found Alphabet's (GOOG, GOOGL) Google search and advertising business to be in violation of antitrust laws. Presiding over the case levied by the Department of Justice, US District Judge Amit P. Mehta wrote \"Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly. \" Many experts are speculating whether this ruling over Google's search dominance could impact another tech giant: Apple (AAPL). Yahoo Finance tech editor Dan Howley explains why this antitrust case could hurt the iPhone maker who has a revenue-sharing agreement with Google to make its search engine the default on its smartphones. Meanwhile, new earnings reports hit the market on Tuesday. Shares of Saudi Aramco (2223. SR) are trading higher after the company met second quarter net income expectations and will pay a quarterly dividend totaling $31. 1 billion. Shares of Yum! Brands (YUM) are also climbing despite reporting mixed second quarter results. While the KFC and Taco Bell parent missed revenue expectations and saw same-store sales drop in those chains, its earnings topped analyst forecasts. Yum! Brands attributed the weakness to a softening consumer spending environment and Middle East tensions. This post was written by Melanie Riehl\n",

Markets tanked on Monday, closing the session lower after widespread selling activity: the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) sank by 1,033 points (2. 6%), the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) dropped off by 576 points (3. 43%), and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell by 160 points (3. 0%). iCapital Chief Investment Strategist Anastasia Amoroso explains that the sell-off has been gaining steam, but Monday's action \"feels like a tantrum. \" Amid a slower economy, Amoroso expects defensive trades to outperform and points to tax-exempt municipal bonds as a good opportunity. She also believes real estate is a solid play, as it is a sector best positioned to benefit from an interest rate cut. While the technology sector is being hammered by a global sell-off, Amoroso argues that in the longer-term, investors could buy some of the semiconductor stocks that benefit from AI on the dip.

      "Lucid Group's significant sovereign wealth funds ownership suggests that the key decisions are influenced by shareholders from the larger publicPublic Investment Fund owns 60% of the company Institutions own 12% of Lucid GroupEvery investor in Lucid Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:LCID) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are sovereign wealth funds with 60% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk). And individual investors on the other hand have a 26% ownership in the company. Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Lucid Group. View our latest analysis for Lucid Group Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index. We can see that Lucid Group does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Lucid Group's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story. Lucid Group is not owned by hedge funds. The company's largest shareholder is Public Investment Fund, with ownership of 60%. This essentially means that they have extensive influence, if not outright control, over the future of the corporation. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 3. 6% of common stock, and BlackRock, Inc. holds about 1. 8% of the company stock. In addition, we found that Peter Rawlinson, the CEO has 0. 5% of the shares allocated to their name. While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily. The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves. Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances. We can see that insiders own shares in Lucid Group, Inc. . The insiders have a meaningful stake worth US$164m. It is good to see this level of investment. You can check here to see if those insiders have been buying recently. The general public-- including retail investors -- own 26% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run. It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Lucid Group better, we need to consider many other factors. For example, we've discovered 2 warning signs for Lucid Group that you should be aware of before investing here. If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink. Luckily, you can check this free report showing analyst forecasts for its future.

      "Shares of broadband and fiber network operator Lumen Technologies (NYSE: LUMN) rocketed 75. 2% higher this week, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. The company reported a surge of new revenue deals related to artificial intelligence (AI) and also reported earnings this week. While Lumen has struggled under a heavy debt load with declining legacy businesses in recent years, the AI revolution appears to be offering Lumen new growth opportunities. Because of its depressed valuation and the surprise AI news, the beaten-down deep value stock soared. There were some hints over the past few weeks that a breakout was coming for Lumen. On July 24, Lumen announced a deal with Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) according to which Lumen would use Microsoft's cloud tools to modernize and streamline its own tech stack, which the company said would save $20 million over the next 12 months. In addition, Microsoft named Lumen as a strategic partner for new and existing low-latency fiber routes to connect artificial intelligence data centers, which increasingly require fast inter-data-center connectivity. Lumen then followed that up on Aug. 1, announcing a deal with fiber cable giant Corning (NYSE: GLW), reserving 10% of Corning's fiber capacity for the next two years. That lent confidence to Lumen's next-gen AI network initiative. Then this week, Lumen put some hard numbers to its AI opportunity. On Monday, Aug. 5, it announced $5 billion in AI-related deals, as well as $7 billion in new potential deals currently under discussion. That announcement sent the stock soaring the next day. Then, after the bell on Tuesday, Aug. 6, Lumen's earnings report took things up another notch. While Lumen's bottom line missed expectations, the company actually beat expectations for revenue. Some green shoots on revenue seemed to overwhelm the bottom-line miss, which the company attributed to investment in the AI opportunity. Notably, the company has separated its product set into three categories -- \"grow,\" \"nurture,\" and \"harvest\" -- according to whether the products are set for growth, declining, or somewhere in between. The grow segment continued to see positive growth, while the nurture and harvest segments saw slowing declines. Overall, the company's revenue decline slowed, perhaps indicating a long-awaited inflection to growth isn't too far away. And perhaps extra pleasing to investors was CEO Kate Johnson's announcement of a $1 billion cost-cutting program by 2027. So the combination of new AI deals along with a big cost-cutting plan was music to investors' ears. Lumen's gains this week are momentous because it was a deep value stock for which bankruptcy was a distinct possibility heading into the year. And even with all the current positive news, revenue and EBITDA did decline last quarter, while the company still holds a heavy $18. 6 billion debt load. So the stock is still risky. But with big, well-funded AI and cloud names needing more connectivity as they build out more data centers, it seems that Lumen may have a new growth business on its hands. With its debt having been restructured earlier this year and maturities pushed out to future years, giving Johnson more time to complete her turnaround, it appears that a lot of progress is being made.

      "The tech sector is under pressure as Wall Street seeks real returns and results from its AI investments. Lumen Technologies (LUMN) CEO Kate Johnson joins Market Domination to discuss the AI hype and the technology's trajectory. \"Every single new piece of technology goes through a J-curve. Just because the big companies are well-capitalized and have a ton of cash doesn't mean that they have to produce return on the first dollar spent. . . And these companies, what they're seeing is this need for a different level of infrastructure, higher bandwidth, thicker pipes, faster pipes. And they're committing the capital to build out this critical infrastructure for decades to come,\" Johnnson explains. She notes that these companies are working on 10 and 20-year plans, and investors won't see immediate returns. With the continued growth of AI demand, Jonshon says that Lumen is going through a huge transition: \"We're upskilling, reskilling.

      "Shares of Lumen Technologies (LUMN) are soaring largely due to its partnership with Microsoft (MSFT), among other companies, which will use Lumen to expand and improve its data centers as AI demand continues to surge. Lumen Technologies CEO Kate Johnson joins Market Domination to the partnership and Lumen's AI initiatives. \"Our pivot to growth is really all about networking. We're a networking company. We run a very significant portion of the world's internet traffic on our backbone. And what you've been hearing about in the market is really a massive expansion of our network and the internet at large to start building the infrastructure for the AI economy,\" Johnson explains. Lumen has partnered with more than 15 different companies, bringing in $5 billion and getting \"anointed as the trusted network for AI. \"She says that free cash flow will allow Lumen to build a \"digital platform to make it super easy, quick, secure, effortless to consume network services. \" She argues that this moment is the \"tip of the spear\" in a three-phase process of building out its AI backbone. The first phase is hyperscalers, technology companies, cloud companies, all of the companies that build AI models and train them are seeing the proliferation of data, and they're seeing that the internet of yesterday does not serve the AI of tomorrow,\" she explains. The second phase is focused on enterprises that need more networking capacity for inference models. The third and final phase is when AI is more integrated into everyday lives and data proliferation explodes. Johnson adds that Lumen's long-term vision is to build \"critical infrastructure for decades. \"For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination.

      "Who needs a rodeo when you've got Lumen Technologies  (LUMN) ?Investors in the Monroe, Louisiana-based telecom may feel like they've been riding a bucking bronco as the struggling company's stock suddenly went yeehawing into the stratosphere. Related: Analysts overhaul Super Micro stock price targets after Q4 earningsLumen shares soared 33% on August 7, and they're up nearly 300% from a year ago after the company said that it had secured $5 billion in new business thanks to the artificial intelligence explosion's heavy demand for connectivity. Large companies across industry sectors are seeking to secure fiber capacity quickly, Lumen said, \"as this resource becomes increasingly valuable and potentially limited, due to booming AI needs. \"The 94-year-old company—which started out as the Oak Ridge Telephone Co. in 1930—said the new business includes a deal with Microsoft  (MSFT) . The software giant will use Lumen network equipment to expand its capacity for AI workloads. As part of the deal, Lumen, formerly known as CenturyLink, will tap Microsoft's Azure cloud services to cut costs. Microsoft has said that a shortage of data center infrastructure needed to deploy AI models was hampering its ability to capitalize on the current uproar in the technology, according to Reuters. Lumen also has a deal with Corning  (GLW)  as the optics material company’s preferred partner \"for its next-generation fiber-dense cable, which will help accommodate the increased data processing that AI requires. \"On top of that, Lumen said it is \"in active discussions\" with customers to nail down another $7 billion in sales to meet the increased demand. Related: Microsoft stock tumbles after key segment disappointsKate Johnson, Lumen’s president and CEO, discussed the company’s recent successes in an earnings call with analysts. \"I'm cognizant of the timing of this call because over the past two days, the markets have been a bit noisy with lots of uncertainty about the health of the economy in the next six to 12 to 18 months,\" she said. \"In contrast, the announcement we made last night about Lumen's pivot to growth is all about building critical infrastructure to support the AI economy for the next several decades,\" Johnson added. Bear in mind, that this is the same company that said in March it was closing of a series of financial transactions that would give Lumen \"strengthened liquidity position\" and announced in April that it was trimming 7% of its workforce--over 1,000 staffers- to align with Lumen's \"shapeshifting and focus on its strategic priorities. \"Lumen also earned a ranking of 99 out of 100 on Debtwire's Likely to Distress (LTD) scoreboard, according to LightReading. So what's going on?“To summarize what's happening,” Johnson told analysts, “the dramatic rise in AI innovation springs explosive growth in data center build-outs, and data centers simply have to be connected. ”\"And while we're excited by the progress of our operational turnaround in legacy core network services,\" she noted, \"the real breakthrough to share with you is how we're repositioning the company for the future in the growing market of AI. \"Lumen reported a second-quarter loss of 13 cents per share, down from earnings of 10 cents per share a year ago, and missing the Zacks consensus for a loss of 9 cents per share. Revenue totaled $3. 27 billion, down 10. 7% from a year ago and edging estimates of $3. 26 billion. Free cash flow, money that is left over after a business pays its operating expenses, was negative $156 million compared with negative $896 million a year ago. Christopher David Stansbury, chief financial officer, said that sales of PCF, Lumen’s modular network fabric that allows companies to design custom network architecture, will close any free cash flow deficit between now and “when we reach sustainable positive free cash flow growth. ”\"We will have ample free cash flow to invest in our transformation and reduce debt,\" he said. Several analysts adjusted their price targets after Lumen announced its results and business deals. More AI Stocks:Nvidia stock tumbles in tech slump amid questions over key chipMicrosoft exec warns of an ongoing problemApple earnings top forecasts, iPhone sales slip ahead of AI launchTD Cowen raised the firm's price target on Lumen to $7 from $2. 50 and kept a hold rating on the shares, according to The Fly. The firm said Lumen posted mixed second-quarter results, trumped by an update on its GenAI wins. There are still many unknowns, but essentially, the company is to receive meaningful upfront cash from hyper scalers to fund meaningful buildouts. MoffettNathanson raised the firm's price target on Lumen to $3 from $1 and kept a sell rating on the shares. The stock has surged nearly seven-fold over the last few weeks due to the market waking up to the idea that there has been a legitimate uplift in demand for fiber infrastructure to support the growth in artificial intelligence data centers, the firm said. Lumen's announced deals with Microsoft to expand its network capacity and with Corning, in which Lumen reserved 10% of Corning's global fiber capacity over the next two years, \"confirmed that this is real. \"However, MoffettNathanson said the company still faces steep revenue declines in its existing business. Goldman Sachs upgraded Lumen to neutral from sell with a price target of $4, up from $1.

      "We recently compiled a list of the 7 Best EV Stocks Under $50. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO) stands against the other EV stocks under $50. Since 2018, electric vehicle (EV) sales have been rapidly growing as the world tries to reach its carbon neutrality goal by 2050. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), only 2% of new vehicles registered globally were electric vehicles, and reached 18% by the end of 2023. Even though most of these sales were concentrated in China, Europe, and the US, other markets such as India, Thailand, Vietnam, and Latin America have also been adopting the EV trend at a fast pace. In 2024, while the high costs due to interest rates stalled EV sales a little, they are still growing at a significant pace as the sales reached 3. 4 million units in Q1, compared to 2. 6 million in the first quarter of 2023, according to the IEA. Furthermore, the accounting and consulting firm, PwC analyzed 21 markets and found out that in the second quarter of 2024, 37% of vehicles sold in these markets were battery-electric vehicles (BEVs), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), or hybrids, marking an increase from 30% in the same period of 2023. At the same time, overall EV sales rose by 21% compared to Q2 2023, while sales of internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles declined by 9% during the same period. BloombergNEF's Long-Term Electric Vehicle Outlook shows that as technology improves and battery prices drop, EV adoption is increasingly driven by consumer demand. Passenger EV sales are expected to surpass 30 million units in 2027 and reach 73 million units by 2040. Despite such progress, strong policy support is still needed, as only 69% of the global car fleet is expected to be electrified by 2050 in the base case scenario, short of the 100% target in the Net Zero scenario. Heavy trucks and other segments lag in reaching net zero and full combustion vehicle sales need to stop by 2038 to reach the goal. The report states that the global EV market could reach $63 trillion by 2050, with significant investment needed in battery production and charging infrastructure. According to estimates by Fortune Business Insights, the global EV market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 13. 8% from 2024 to 2032, and Asia is currently the dominant region with a 51. 24% market share. This is the time for investors to take positions in EV stocks, as the EV market is just getting started and is poised for a lot of growth. Our MethodologyFor this article, we used the FinViz stock screener to identify over 25 electric vehicle manufacturers with a stock price of under $50, as of August 7.

      "There's been a lot going on between enduring the sweltering summer heat, kicking back and watching the Olympics, and getting ready for back-to-school season. But the stock market just had arguably its most dramatic month of the year, with many mega-cap tech stocks plummeting, plenty of rebounds across small caps, and surprisingly red-hot runs in value-focused sectors like utilities. No matter the cause or complexion of market gyrations, it's important to filter out the noise and focus on the companies that have what it takes to grow their earnings -- and in some cases their dividends -- over time. Here's why these five Motley Fool contributors are especially excited about The Trade Desk (NASDAQ: TTD), Nio (NYSE: NIO), Visa (NYSE: V), Enbridge (NYSE: ENB), and Walmart (NYSE: WMT) as top stocks to buy in August. Anders Bylund (The Trade Desk): Digital marketing expert The Trade Desk has seen some volatility lately. The stock has gained more than 25% year to date, but it also trades more than 12% below its recent multiyear highs. One might think it's an expensive investment, since the stock trades at a lofty 223 times trailing earnings and 80 times free cash flow. But you're also looking at a sector leader with stellar sales growth, working in an online advertising industry with plenty of growth catalysts up its collective sleeve. The 2024 Paris Olympic Games are on the air, with world-class sports content available across several streaming platforms. It's also an election year, with lots of political ad content across every conceivable media type. These events tend to go hand in hand every leap year, often with market-moving consequences. And the digital marketing sector is coming back from a couple of rough years when ad buyers held onto their wallets due to raging inflation. Why spend a ton of money on targeted marketing when no one is ready to buy your goods and services? The upswing from that dark trough could be impressive, releasing years of pent-up advertising demand in a few short months. So The Trade Desk is poised to perform in August and beyond. Its earnings are expected to jump 29% higher year over year in Friday's second-quarter report. Sales should also soar by at least 25%, according to the analyst consensus, though the company has a habit of leaving analyst estimates far behind. This stock can be volatile, and I can't guarantee that it won't ever be cheaper than it is today. But if you don't have The Trade Desk in your stock portfolio yet, you're missing out on a tremendous growth stock with robust business prospects, both in the near term and over the long haul. You should consider grabbing a few shares in this compelling price dip. Neha Chamaria (Nio): The once red-hot electric vehicle (EV) stocks have hit a speed bump in recent months amid fears of a global slowdown. That includes Nio's stock, which has crashed a whopping 50% so far this year. I believe the sell-off is now overdone, and the second half of the year could be a lot better for the Chinese EV maker and give its stock price a much-needed boost. Nio's deliveries and margins fell consistently for some quarters but now show signs of a recovery. In the first quarter, for example, Nio delivered a little over 30,000 EVs, which was down 3% year over year and nearly 40% from the fourth quarter of 2023. Nio's deliveries, however, have improved significantly since, with the company even surpassing management's estimates and delivering more than 57,000 units in the second quarter. To be sure, one quarter alone does not signal an uptrend, but there's a valid reason to believe that Nio's deliveries should continue to rise. The thing is, Nio started upgrading all of its models late last year, which hurt production and sales. The upgrades were completed in April, which is also when Nio's deliveries picked up. I expect the trend to continue, and as its deliveries rise, so should its vehicle and gross margins. Dwindling margins were among the biggest factors that weighed on the stock's price. Meanwhile, Nio also launched a mass-market brand called Onvo in May and expects to start deliveries of its first midsize SUV, the L60, in late September. Expectations are high since the L60 will compete with EV leader Tesla's (NASDAQ: TSLA) hot-selling Model Y and offer better pricing. Overall, with Nio's deliveries on the rise and margins likely to rebound, the EV stock looks like a compelling buy at current prices. Daniel Foelber (Visa): When looking for stocks, it's easy to get too caught up in the price action and use it as a yardstick for where a stock has been and where it could be headed. A better way to determine which stocks to buy is to take a step back and think about the qualities that make up an excellent business, and then find companies that match that profile. Visa has been a company I've admired for some time. Its global position has never been stronger. And yet the stock has sold off 12% in the past four months. I think it's a compelling stock to buy in August. Visa has a diverse revenue stream spanning domestic and international markets, credit cards and debit cards, and consumers and corporate clients. The business model is essentially perfect: Charge a flat fee per transaction and a variable fee based on the size of the transaction. Visa wins whether you tap your card and spend $1 or $1,000, but it makes more if it's the latter. Visa often gets roped into cyclical stock conversations. And while it's true that it benefits from increased spending and economic growth, it strikes me as more of a staple at this point. The transition to cashless digital and mobile payments has accelerated growth for credit card companies. It wasn't long ago that you would have to convert U. S. dollars to local currency in cash when traveling abroad. But now, the conversions are automatic using a Visa card, which is one of the reasons Visa's international segment is growing faster than its domestic one. Visa fell after reporting its third-quarter results. U. S. payments volume declined, and international growth was weighed down by a poor performance in China. Still, Visa's results are respectable. Better yet, Visa's key valuation metrics like price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales, and price-to-free cash flow are all below historical levels. It now has a lower P/E than the S&P 500 even though it is arguably a much better business than the average component in the index. To top it off, Visa generates a boatload of free cash flow that it uses to buy back stock and pay a growing dividend. Don't let Visa's 0. 8% yield fool you -- if it wanted to, it could pay nearly four times that if it reallocated the money it was using for buybacks on dividends instead. However, buybacks have historically been a much better use of capital because Visa has been a market-outperforming stock, and the buybacks have helped reduce the share count -- thereby boosting earnings per share and making Visa a better value. Add it all up, and Visa is a near-perfect business that you don't have to pay a premium price for. Keith Speights (Enbridge): I realize that ultra-high-yield dividend stocks might not be everyone's cup of tea. But Enbridge could be worth a sip for any investor in August, even if you're not looking for income. Enbridge ranks as a leader in the North American energy sector. The company operates pipelines and terminals that transport and store crude oil, natural gas, and other liquid hydrocarbons. It also has a natural gas utility business and owns solar and wind assets in renewable energy. With a dividend yield of over 7. 2%, Enbridge doesn't have to deliver much share price appreciation for investors to enjoy attractive total returns. Although the stock hasn't performed especially well so far in 2024, I think Enbridge's growth prospects are pretty good. The company can count on 1% to 2% annual growth in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) from its inflation-based revenue escalators and cost-cutting programs alone. Enbridge is investing in several pipeline expansions that could drive further growth. It also recently completed the acquisition of Questar Gas from Dominion Energy. I like its risk profile. Over 98% of its cash flow is contracted or part of cost-of-service arrangements. More than 95% of the company's customers are investment-grade. Around 80% of Enbridge's EBITDA is protected from inflation. Last, but certainly not least, Enbridge is reasonably valued. The stock trades below 17. 6 times forward earnings. Demitri Kalogeropoulos (Walmart): Retailing giant Walmart will announce its second-quarter results in mid-August, but investors don't have to wait until then to buy this sturdy dividend stock. The company gave investors plenty to cheer in its last visit to the earnings plate back in May, with sales and profitability both rising in the first quarter. Walmart enjoyed strong customer traffic in its online business and at stores, helping it stand out against rivals like Target. I would expect those trends to continue when the company reports fresh results on Aug. 15. Besides customer traffic, watch Walmart's profit margin in August. Operating income growth should slightly exceed the 4% uptick in expected second-quarter revenue, just as it has for most of the past year. The retailer is getting help in this department from strong demand for its low-priced products, but also from margin-boosting revenue streams like online advertising. Falling inventory last quarter, meanwhile, also sets the stage for another strong period for earnings. Looking further out, shareholders can expect Walmart to return more of its ample cash flow in the form of dividends and stock buybacks. Sure, the stock yields below 1. 5% today, and you can get higher initial income by owning Target or Home Depot. Yet Walmart has returned about $3 billion to investors in each of the past two quarters, split roughly evenly between buybacks and dividend spending. And the chain's recent 9% hike shows management's commitment to prioritizing a rising payout. Unlike most of the products it sells, Walmart's stock isn't especially cheap at nearly 30 times trailing earnings. Investors should still consider building up a position in the market leader to benefit from its strengthening profitability over the coming years.

      "NIO Inc. (NIO) has recently been on Zacks. com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future. Shares of this company have returned -16. 6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0. 4% change. The Zacks Automotive - Foreign industry, to which NIO belongs, has lost 11. 3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making. Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock. Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements. For the current quarter, NIO is expected to post a loss of $0. 46 per share, indicating a change of +9. 8% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days. For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of -$1. 41 points to a change of +19. 4% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged. For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of -$1 indicates a change of +29. 6% from what NIO is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged. With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for NIO. The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth. In the case of NIO, the consensus sales estimate of $2. 35 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +94. 5%. The $9. 24 billion and $15. 26 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +18. 6% and +65. 2%, respectively. NIO reported revenues of $1. 37 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -11. 7%. EPS of -$0. 36 for the same period compares with -$0. 42 a year ago. Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1. 48 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -7. 42%. The EPS surprise was -16. 13%. Over the last four quarters, NIO surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period. Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects. While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price. The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued. NIO is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade. The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks. com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about NIO. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "American depositary shares of Chinese electric-vehicle (EV) maker Nio (NYSE: NIO) plunged Thursday after the company announced its July monthly delivery results. Those results weren't bad, but investors wanted more. Nio delivered about 20,500 EVs last month, marking the third straight month the company has surpassed the 20,000 unit delivery threshold. But it was still only about 2% higher than the year-ago period. Nio closed today's trading session with a drop of 8. 3%. The July delivery results also represented a slight drop from the 21,209 vehicles shipped in June. Investors are getting impatient waiting for Nio to achieve profitability. They expected to see a continued ramp-up of vehicle sales, but as can be seen in the chart below, results have leveled off over the past several months. Nio still has delivered about 44% more EVs in 2024 year to date, compared to 2023. But investors expected 2024 to be a year of sharp increases in production and sales. After all, that's what will be required to achieve profitability. This helps explain why the stock is down by 55% so far this year. The other thing investors likely noticed was that Chinese EV peer Li Auto reported July deliveries that soared by about 50%, compared to July 2023. It also showed an increase month over month from June. Nio stock likely won't gain any traction without a catalyst that pushes it meaningfully toward profitability. While July delivery results weren't bad, they didn't provide a noticeable boost toward that goal.

      "China’s economic landscape is getting more and more complicated for electric vehicle (EV) producers. Most recently, government officials confirmed that the nation will not be issuing an additional round of stimulus for the second half of 2024. As a result, many companies are struggling in the market today, including prominent Chinese EV stocks. Many Chinese automakers are still recovering from a highly volatile July and so far, August isn’t off to a good start. Indeed, the outlook appears questionable at best as automakers face rising competition and China’s government grapples with slowing gross domestic product (GDP) growth. So far today, Nio (NYSE:NIO) stock is having a worse day than most of its peers. As of this writing, shares of NIO are down more than 9% for the day. But plenty of other Chinese EV stocks are in the red as well. Sector leader BYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDY) is down about 4% so far while Xpeng (NYSE:XPEV) stock is down 5%. Finally, Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI) is doing better than its competitors but still falling almost 2%. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhile Chinese EV stocks are struggling, other industries stand to be impacted as well due to China’s broad economic problems. CNBC notes that the nation may not be able to achieve its 5% full-year growth target, according to some experts. The outlet reports:“The economy faces challenges not only from the external environment but also from structural transformation — ‘pain that must be experienced in the process of pushing for high-quality development,’ Zhao Chenxin, deputy director of the National Development and Reform Commission, told reporters Thursday. ”Anticipation of further stimulus funding helped boost some Chinese EV stocks recently, including Nio. As InvestorPlace’s Eddie Pan notes, such a measure could have potentially helped generate demand for Nio’s vehicles. But now that China’s economic planning agency and finance ministry officials have confirmed that stimulus won’t be coming, NIO stock is back to falling — and Nio is back to facing a questionable future. With many Chinese EV stocks caught on the wrong side of this public policy matter, it may be hard for most investors to be optimistic about their chances of recovery. Strong companies like BYD, which has been working overtime to expand into new markets, may bounce back soon. But for stocks like NIO, which have failed to generate sustainable momentum even after reporting good news, it may not be so easy. Even a positive update regarding Nio’s use of autonomous driving technology hasn’t been enough to keep shares in the green. In times like these, investors should examine China’s EV sector from a macro perspective. Automakers that have already proven themselves to be winners will stay on the road to success, even if their progress is gradual. But companies that were already struggling will have a much tougher time.

      "Nu Holdings (NYSE: NU) began trading on the public markets in December 2021. It's been anything but a smooth ride since then. Shares tanked 57% in 2022. But since the start of 2023, this fintech stock has skyrocketed 176% (as of Aug. 6). There might be more upside over the long term. As of this writing, shares of Nu trade below $15, pressured by a 17% dip after mid-July. Does this make it a no-brainer buying opportunity?Nu Holdings is a digital banking powerhouse. Without the need for physical bank branches, and using a mobile-first approach, the business offers customers various financial services products to tackle their banking needs. Nu has a huge presence in Brazil, but it also operates in Mexico and Colombia. It's amazing the success that companies can register by simply using technology to create a superior user experience. It helps Nu's situation that Latin America's population is severely unbanked or underbanked. Rising internet and smartphone penetration also adds a supportive backdrop that can expand Nu's total addressable market. Investors are enamored with Nu's financial gains. In 2023, the company grew revenue by a jaw-dropping 68% year over year. This momentum carried over into this year, with Q1 2024 sales up 64%. This was driven by Nu adding 5. 4 million net new customers to its platform during the three-month period. This trend of rapid growth should continue with better cross-selling, adding more accounts, and improved monetization. It's common to see companies growing this rapidly post consistent net losses. After all, management teams adopt the philosophy of investing aggressively into product development and sales and marketing. The promise is that positive earnings will be achieved at some point well into the future. To its credit, Nu bucks this trend. It's already on a financially sustainable path. Net income surged 160% in Q1 to $379 million. That was a faster pace of growth than the top line, indicating a scalable business model. And this was the seventh straight quarter of positive and rising profits. The benefit of not having to operate brick-and-mortar branches and not having to deal with those overhead expenses can result in long-term profitable growth for Nu. \"While we are encouraged by the first-quarter results, it's again important to emphasize our commitment to managing our business for long-term value creation,\" CFO Guilherme Marques do Lago said on the Q1 2024 earnings call. According to Wall Street consensus analyst estimates, Nu is expected to increase earnings per share from $0. 21 in 2023 to $0. 77 in 2026, translating to a remarkable compound annual growth rate of 53%. It's always smart to be skeptical of forecasts, but Nu's trajectory is impressive without a doubt, making it easy for investors to be bullish. Nu is finding remarkable success in Latin America, a region ripe for fintech disruption. Its revenue and income growth are superb. But there's another must-know reason to like the business. Berkshire Hathaway has been a shareholder since Nu's initial public offering, with the conglomerate currently owning 2. 2% of the outstanding stock. It's unclear if Warren Buffett or someone else on his team found this business. However, realizing the expert bank analyst the Oracle of Omaha is a shareholder should give prospective investors confidence that Nu is a worthy investment candidate. Weakness in the market has propelled a 17% decline in Nu shares from their peak price that was established last month. The stock now trades at a compelling forward price-to-earnings ratio of 28. With shares well below $15, they look like a smart buying opportunity for long-term investors. Before you buy stock in Nu Holdings, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nu Holdings wasn’t one of them.

      "Nu Holdings Ltd. NU will report its second-quarter 2024 results on Aug 13, after the bell. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in the to-be-reported stands at 10 cents, indicating 11% sequential growth. The consensus estimate for revenues is pegged at $2. 9 billion, indicating 6. 1% sequential growth. There has been no change in analyst estimates or revisions lately. Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company has an impressive earnings surprise history. Earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters, matched once and missed once, with an average earnings surprise of 13. 9%. Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOur proven model doesn’t conclusively predict an earnings beat for NU this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. But that’s not the case here. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. NU has an Earnings ESP of 0. 00% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. We expect that the significant year-over-year improvement in the company’s top line in the to-be-reported quarter will be driven by strong customer growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for active customers is pegged at 85. 5 million, suggesting 3. 5% sequential growth. NU's low-cost operating platform and revenue strength are expected to impact the bottom line in the quarter positively. The stock has declined 7. 2% in the past month compared with the 8. 7% decline of the industry and the 6% fall in the Zacks S&P 500 composite. Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe performance of its closest competitors has not been impressive as well, with Banco Santander (Brasil) S. A. BSBR barely moving and SoFi Technologies SOFI gaining just 1% over the same period. Looking beyond the one-month performance, NU’s stock has surged 20. 3% over the past six months and 42. 7% year to date, indicating that the current downturn is part of a correction phase. NU is currently trading at a discount relative to its industry. If we look at the forward 12-month Price/Earnings ratio, NU shares currently trade at 21. 95X forward earnings, significantly lower than the industry’s 33. 42. Based on trailing 12-month EV-to-EBITDA, NU is currently trading at 21. 62X, way below the industry’s 53. 65X. NU's success in Brazil, driven by a solid brand, efficient cost structure and improved monetization, is expanding into Latin America, including Mexico and Colombia. In the first quarter of 2024, revenues grew 69% year-over-year, and adjusted net income surged 143%, with a customer base increase of 5. 5 million, reaching 99. 3 million globally. The digitization trend supports further growth. Despite challenges like foreign exchange risks and competition, NU’s future is promising, with growth expected from geographic expansion in Argentina, Peru, Chile and Uruguay and enhancing services in current markets. NU, currently available at a discount relative to its industry, offers an attractive investment opportunity. With a robust business model, impressive growth potential in both revenues and profit and an expanding customer base, NU is well-positioned for continued success. The company's strategic initiatives and strong market presence make it a top pick for investors looking to gain exposure to the fintech sector this earnings season.

      "FiscalNote Holdings, Inc. (NOTE) came out with a quarterly loss of $0. 09 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $0. 13. This compares to loss of $0. 23 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items. This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 30. 77%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this company would post a loss of $0. 17 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0. 12, delivering a surprise of 29. 41%. Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. FiscalNote Holdings, Inc. , which belongs to the Zacks Technology Services industry, posted revenues of $29. 25 million for the quarter ended June 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0. 69%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $32. 84 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters. The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call. FiscalNote Holdings, Inc. Shares have added about 21. 9% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 9%. While FiscalNote Holdings, Inc. Has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately. Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions. Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for FiscalNote Holdings, Inc. Mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is -$0. 11 on $30. 93 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $0. 03 on $124. 63 million in revenues for the current fiscal year. Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Technology Services is currently in the top 41% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. Another stock from the same industry, Nu Holdings Ltd. (NU), has yet to report results for the quarter ended June 2024. The results are expected to be released on August 13.

      "The Business Services group has plenty of great stocks, but investors should always be looking for companies that are outperforming their peers. Mitie Group PLC. (MITFY) is a stock that can certainly grab the attention of many investors, but do its recent returns compare favorably to the sector as a whole?

      "It might seem tough to get started in the stock market with just $3,000, especially when many popular stocks cost hundreds or thousands of dollars per share. But there's no rule that requires investors to buy a round lot of 100 shares, while most brokerages now make it easier to invest in higher-valued stocks with fractional trades. So instead of thinking $3,000 isn't enough to build a diversified portfolio, smaller retail investors should simply crack open Warren Buffett's investment portfolio at Berkshire Hathaway to find some good starter stocks. So today, let's review Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), and Nu Holdings (NYSE: NU) -- which are reliable defensive, growth, and emerging market plays, respectively, for building a well-diversified portfolio. Coca-Cola has been one of Berkshire Hathaway's top investments since 1988 and still accounts for 7. 1% of its portfolio. It's a solid long-term investment for three reasons: It's one of the world's largest beverage companies, it thrives through economic downturns, and it's raised its payout annually for 62 consecutive years. Coca-Cola might seem like a risky stock to own as soda consumption rates decline, but the company constantly expands its portfolio with more brands of bottled water, teas, juices, sports drinks, energy drinks, coffee, and even alcoholic beverages to offset that pressure. The company also refreshes its sodas with smaller serving sizes, new flavors and versions to attract new consumers. For 2024, Coca-Cola expects its organic revenue to rise 9% to 10% as its comparable earnings per share (EPS) grows 5% to 6%. The stock still looks reasonably valued at 24 times forward earnings, and pays an attractive forward dividend yield of 2. 8%. So if you invest $3,000 in Coca-Cola today, you can earn about $84 in annual dividends as you ride out the near-term macro headwinds. If you had invested $3,000 in Coca-Cola with Warren Buffett at the start of 1988 and reinvested your dividends, your stake would be worth $206,400 today and paying out $5,780 in annual dividends. Past performance never guarantees future returns, but Coca-Cola is still one of the few blue-chip stalwarts that I'd consider a \"forever\" stock. Berkshire Hathaway started to buy shares of Amazon, the world's largest e-commerce and cloud platform company, in 2019. Amazon now accounts for 0. 4% of Berkshire's portfolio. The company's cloud platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS), operates at much higher margins than its e-commerce business. That allows it to subsidize the expansion of its lower-margin retail marketplaces with its higher-margin cloud revenues. That flywheel helps Amazon lock in its online shoppers with steep discounts, loss-leading strategies, and other perks for its Prime members. It also consistently widens its moat against other brick-and-mortar and online retailers. Amazon's stock recently tumbled after its second-quarter revenue missed analysts' estimates and management provided soft guidance for the third quarter. That slowdown was mainly caused by macro and competitive headwinds for its e-commerce business. On the bright side, AWS' growth accelerated over the past year as more companies expanded their cloud infrastructure to run new generative AI services. That growth engine should offset the softness of Amazon's retail business in this tougher macro environment, so analysts still expect its revenue and earnings to rise 11% and 58%, respectively, this year. The stock isn't cheap at 36 times forward earnings, but it's still a great long-term play on the expanding e-commerce and cloud markets. Nu Holdings, which operates in Brazil, Mexico, and Colombia, owns one of the largest online banks in Latin America. It nearly doubled in size from 53. 9 million customers at the end of 2021 to more than 100 million customers today. Its online-only strategy helped it expand a lot faster than brick-and-mortar competitors, and it locks in its customers with a wide range of financial services. Berkshire Hathaway invested in Nu's IPO in 2021, and the stock currently accounts for 0. 3% of its portfolio. In constant currency terms, Nu's revenue soared 168% in 2022 and 63% in 2023. Over the past year, its monthly average revenue per active customer grew as its average costs of serving each customer declined. Gross margins also held steady as the company's net interest margins expanded. In other words, Nu's hypergrowth rates seem sustainable -- and it should maintain that momentum as it expands beyond those three core markets and locks in more unbanked and underbanked customers across Latin America. Analysts expect Nu's revenue and adjusted EPS to rise 45% and 64%, respectively, in USD terms in 2024. Those are stellar growth rates for a stock that trades at just 25 times forward earnings, but its valuations are being squeezed by concerns about inflation and other macro headwinds. If Nu continues to expand and the macro environment warms up, the stock could easily command a higher valuation and generate multibagger returns from a modest $3,000 investment over the next few years.

      "The S&P 500 continues to climb and reach new highs. It's up 14% this year, fueled by the success of many artificial intelligence (AI) stocks, many of which are some of the biggest stocks on the market. Bull markets are the time to buy growth stocks, which tend to outperform the market when the market is doing well. Lemonade (NYSE: LMND), SoFi Technologies (NASDAQ: SOFI), and Nu Holdings (NYSE: NU) are three great candidates. Lemonade sells insurance, but it's not your typical insurance company. For one thing, it has no sales staff. It's almost entirely digital, and it relies on AI to underwrite policies at the right prices and for many other parts of its operation. It's been around now for almost 10 years and has more than 2 million customers. That's still a drop in the bucket compared with the big, traditional insurance companies, but it's fast growth for a young upstart. The premium per customer increased 8% year over year in the 2024 second quarter, and the in-force premium, the standard top-line metric for insurance companies, was up 22%. There are two main reasons Lemonade stock has flopped over the past few years. One is profitability, or lack thereof, and the other is an increasing, or at least volatile, loss ratio. But it's been making progress on both of these ends. Net loss was still heavy in Q2 at $57 million, but it was an improvement from $67 million last year, and loss per share of $0. 81 was better than the $0. 88 analysts were expecting. The loss ratio was 79%, down from 94% last year, and a continuation of a positive trend over the past few quarters. Lemonade stock fell after its earnings report despite its strong quarter. The market may be concerned about slowing growth, which could hinder its ability to scale and turn a profit. Lemonade has already climbed back from its recent lows, and as it makes progress, it may not go back down there. Even though Lemonade stock dipped after the report, it didn't fall very hard. From here, it could continue to climb higher, making now a good time to buy for investors who have been on the fence. However, it's only for investors who have a high risk tolerance. SoFi similarly had a fantastic quarter, and its stock flip-flopped after its earnings release, ending about where it started. Adjusted revenue increased 22% year over year, and it reported its third consecutive quarter of positive net income. This positive financial trend is expected to continue in Q3 and the full year. SoFi pivoted away from its roots as a student loan cooperative several years ago and is embracing a growth strategy with an expanded collection of products and services. It acquired a bank in 2022 and offers bank accounts, investing accounts, credit cards, and more for a close-to-comprehensive personal-financial app. Lending still makes up the bulk of SoFi's business, but the other services are growing much faster. Financial-services products increased 39% year over year in Q2, and revenue increased 80%. It also has another segment called Tech Platform that services business clients with financial infrastructure, and together, sales from these segments increased 46% year over year, while lending was up 3%. Management expects these segments to increase as a percentage of the total, which benefits SoFi in several ways. Its higher growth rates will positively affect more of the company's sales, and it protects the company under adverse economic conditions like today's high interest rates. Management also notes that it's a lower-cost business. Finally, having a broad array of products and services leads to higher engagement, scale, and profits. Management raised guidance for the full year after the Q2 report, and it also expects the lending segment to perform better than it originally thought. The market didn't receive the results warmly, so you still have a chance to buy it now before it soars. Nu is the only stock on this list that hasn't released Q2 earnings yet. So expect the stock to soar if it comes through with a stellar performance. It has delivered solid results since it went public, and it's likely to do that again. Unlike Lemonade and SoFi, which are both well off their highs, Nu has been an investor favorite for a while, and it's up 44% this year. Nu's business is similar to SoFi's, but it operates in Brazil, its home base, as well as its newer markets of Mexico and Colombia. It's adding customers and generating revenue at a fast pace, and it has many growth drivers that should propel it forward for the foreseeable future. Although most adults in Brazil are already on Nu's platform, it continues to add millions of customers there quarterly.

      "As we inch closer to the first wave of interest rate cuts, it’s an opportune time to consider emerging markets tech stocks. Over the past year or so, these tech giants have undergone a major correction, with analysts highlighting promising opportunities in often-overlooked areas. For instance, Tom Lee of Funstrat Global Advisors paints a dynamic picture for small-cap stocks in August, primed for a 15% jump. These impressive growth numbers are driven by cooling inflation and the upcoming interest rate cuts. Similarly, emerging markets tech stocks are also set to gain immensely from the evolving economic landscape. Hence, investors are looking to capitalize on market adjustments, and investing in the best tech players in emerging markets could prove lucrative over time. However, not all stocks are created equal, especially in emerging markets. That said, here are three stocks that continue executing brilliantly while offering superb upside ahead. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSource: Nor Sham Soyod / Shutterstock. comGrab Holdings (NASDAQ:GRAB) is a Singaporean tech titan that continues to grow at a rapid pace. I discussed in a recent article how the company has blown past top-line estimates in the past nine straight quarters. Moreover, all estimates point to double-digit growth in sales for the foreseeable future, with encouraging progress toward profitability. Analysts expect it to break even with a four-cent profit by next year. Surprisingly, Grab’s stock price hasn’t followed in line with its explosive fundamental growth. Yet, with upcoming rate cuts and a growing appetite for riskier investments, GRAB stock is primed for a tremendous surge in value ahead. Its versatile super app, thriving in Southeast Asia’s rapidly expanding markets, solidifies its compelling growth narrative. In fact, according to the World Economic Forum, the region is on track to become a $1 trillion digital economy by 2030, setting the stage for massive long-term expansion ahead. Source: monticello / Shutterstock. comJumia Technologies (NYSE:JMIA) is a top eCommerce platform in Africa. Within a relatively short time, it swiftly established its presence in the region, becoming a key player in the continent’s rapidly expanding market. Consequently, JMIA stock has surged upwards of 413% in the past nine months, with more upside aside as it continues expanding its market share in the region. Its powerful growth trajectory hasn’t gone unnoticed. Benchmark analysts recently rated the stock as a Buy, forecasting a double-digit upside from current prices. According to Fawne Jiang from Benchmark, Jumia is in an excellent position to capture the “unmet pent-up demand” in the region. Moreover, the International Trade Administration expects north of half a billion eCommerce users in Africa by next year, and 17% annually. Therefore, Jumia offers a compelling, high-risk, high-reward opportunity that offers sustained upside potential. Source: Sittipong Phokawattana/ShutterstockNu Holdings (NYSE:NU) is the largest digital banking platform operating in the Latin American region, boasting north of 100 million customers across the region. With a remarkable 108% growth in its top line over the past five years, Nu Holdings stands out as one of the fastest-growing banks in its niche. Its most recent quarterly report showed an impressive 64% bump in revenues to $2. 7 billion, with deposits surging 53% to $24. 3 billion. Net income also rose significantly to $378. 8 million, up from $141. 8 million the previous year. Furthermore, smart money remains a big gamble on its long-term prospects. Japanese investment giant SoftBank (OTCMKTS:SFTBY) recently added 2. 3 million shares, bringing its total holdings to 23. 3 million. Also, the Saudi Arabian government followed suit, scooping up 1. 18 million shares last quarter. Adding to Nu’s bull-case is its innovative use of proprietary blockchain technology. It recently rolled out multiple blockchain-powered services through its partnership with Lightspark to significantly improve its customers’ banking experience.

      "The \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks -- Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Tesla -- have notably outperformed the stock market over the last five years. For example, the median performer out of the group, Microsoft, has a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 26% during this period. That's nearly double the return generated by the S&P 500 (15%). But investing means looking forward, not backward, and it's always important to ask what would drive a highflying stock even higher. So, which of these stocks could help set investors up for life? Here are the two I have my eye on right now. The first Magnificent Seven stock that can help set investors up for life is Meta Platforms. Meta, which operates social networks including Facebook and Instagram, has more than 3. 3 billion monthly active users (MAUs). That's equal to roughly 40% of the total world population. With so many people accessing its platforms, it's no wonder that the company makes billions off ad placement on its networks. In this year's second quarter, Meta reported $39 billion in revenue, and almost all of it -- some 98% -- came from ad sales. Yet, despite its massive size and singular focus on digital advertising, it remains an unstoppable growth engine. The company grew its total revenue 22% year over year in its most recent quarter, which is outstanding for such a large business. Indeed, it has averaged an incredible 32% quarterly revenue growth dating back to 2014. What's more, Meta isn't just growing its top-line numbers. Take free cash flow (FCF) per share, a crucial financial metric that shows how much cash a company is generating on a per share basis. Meta's free cash flow per share has been steadily rising. The company now generates $18. 82 per share in FCF, up from $6. 60 less than two years ago. That's crucial for investors because FCF per share measures how much money a business is generating, which can then be spent on dividend payments, share buybacks, debt reduction, and other purposes. In other words, it gives a company's leadership the ability to deliver value to shareholders. Thanks to its immense scale and fat profit margins, Meta's business model is likely to continue delivering shareholder value for many years to come. That makes it a stock that could help set investors up for life. Similar to Meta Platforms, Alphabet is a major player in the digital advertising market. Through its Google Search and YouTube segments, the company generates hundreds of billions in ad-based revenue. In the second quarter, Alphabet recorded $85 billion in total revenue. That's nearly $1 billion per day. And $65 billion, or 76%, of this total came from advertising on Google Search, Google Network, and YouTube. What's truly impressive is how efficient Alphabet is at turning its revenue into profits. The company's operating margin is 32%, the highest in more than a decade and well above its 10-year average of 26%. High profitability is key for any stock. It indicates that a company is managing its operations well and is producing profits that can then be used to deliver shareholder value or grow its business. Granted, Alphabet has its challenges, including a recent federal antitrust ruling that is working its way through the courts and the general market volatility that has skyrocketed in recent weeks. But long-term investors should remember that uncertain times are in many ways the best times to invest. Warren Buffett famously said that to the extent investors should follow their emotions, it's better to be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful. Given Alphabet's excellent business model and solid operating margin, smart investors should be giving the internet giant a serious look.

      "Shareholders asked to approve new ESG policies are warming up to the \"G\" even as they continue withholding support for the \"E\" and \"S. \"\"G\" refers to corporate “governance\" changes, and such proposals received considerably more shareholder support this year than proposals targeting environmental (E) or social (S) changes, according to an analysis of ISS-Corporate data conducted by law firm Freshfields. Of the 154 so-called governance proposals that went to a vote between Jan. 1 and June 14, 38 were successful, according to the analysis. Most that passed called for the elimination of supermajority vote requirements for significant company actions, including at California chip maker Nvidia (NVDA). Other successful proposals required that all directors stand for reelection each year or empowered shareholders to call special meetings. That 25% success rate is considerably higher than E and S proposals that would force companies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, adopt more sustainable supply chain practices, and adopt diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) targets. Just two environmentally focused proposals received majority shareholder backing during the same period measured by Freshfields. The support was even thinner for social proposals. Just one passed, requiring glucose monitoring medical device company DexCom (DXCM) to report its political contributions. That measure received a 52% majority. One possible reason for this divergence is that the G in ESG does not attract the same level of political scrutiny as the E or the S. \"These types of proposals are not considered overly prescriptive on companies and don’t play into any of the backlash to ESG more generally we have seen recently, meaning they tend to have a broader base of support,” said Michael Arnold, a corporate governance attorney with Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP. Both ESG and DEI have been hot-button issues during the 2024 presidential campaign. Former President Donald Trump has promised to banish ESG-minded retirement account investments \"forever,\" while a top Trump ally has called DEI \"bigotry\" against white men. Republican-led states are also pushing companies to rescind race-based employee quotas, piggybacking on the Supreme Court's decision in 2023 to strike down race-based admission policies at Harvard University and the University of North Carolina. This anti-ESG and anti-DEI momentum has forced some companies to peel back some of their existing policies, let alone adopt new ones. Under pressure from shareholders, rural retailer Tractor Supply in June announced that it would retire its DEI goals. Tractor maker John Deere made a similar announcement in July, stating that it would continue to track workforce diversity but end participation in cultural- and social awareness-focused events. But the fact that many E and S proposals were voted down this year may not signal less shareholder interest, according to Freshfields’ Pam Marcogliese. Marcogliese instead suggests that this year's votes could indicate that shareholders have grown more satisfied with companies’ ESG progress and that investors see these latest proposals as too incremental to make a difference. \"Investors maybe don't really think it's worth it because that type of proposal is more about micromanaging the company, rather than really providing more helpful data,\" Marcogliese said. And some of the environmental proposals this season failed only by slim margins. Proposals at Denny’s (DENN), Quest Diagnostics (DGX), and Dine Brands (DIN) came close to receiving majority support, with yes votes hovering around 40%. It should also be noted that there were 51 shareholder proposals that actually opposed companies’ existing DEI efforts — and none of those passed, either. Certainly, shareholders were much more comfortable signing off on certain governance changes. There were 252 such proposals and 38 were successful out of the 154 that went to a vote between Jan. 1 and June 14. Those figures exclude proposals concerning executive compensation. That means that 15% of all governance proposals filed were adopted, up from 7% in 2023, according to Freshfields. For companies included in the Russell 3000, ISS-Corporate said the figure was even higher — at 20% of all proposals filed. The most popular change was to reduce supermajority vote requirements and replace them with simple majority voting standards — a move designed to enhance the rights of shareholders. This was the proposal approved at Nvidia (NVDA). Supermajority vote requirements can make it more challenging to amend a company’s bylaws or charters, making it more difficult to get changes approved. In a recent report — titled \"Are supermajority votes headed for extinction?\" — ISS cited a Tesla (TSLA) vote in 2019 as one example of how supermajority policies can slow things down. That year proposals designed to improve governance practices at the electric vehicle maker received robust support among votes cast, according to ISS, but failed because just 52% of the company’s share capital was represented — as opposed to two-thirds. \"The percentage of S&P 500 companies still employing supermajority rules has declined to just over one third, meaning those retaining the practice increasingly look like outliers and may face more scrutiny and pressure to change,\" ISS said in its report. Not all governance proposals did well this year, however. One notable outlier came with attempts to split the CEO and board chair positions, according to the Freshfields analysis. Of the 44 such proposals, zero passed. Alexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance. Follow Alexis on X @alexiskweed.

      "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a scorching-hot buy over the past couple of years, largely due to the key role it plays in artificial intelligence (AI). The company's AI chips are crucial for companies that are developing AI models. And Nvidia has a commanding 80% market share when it comes to AI chips. That's part of the reason why investors have remained bullish on the stock -- it's arguably the best-positioned stock to benefit from growing demand for AI. But given how lucrative the opportunities are in AI, it's only a matter of time before more competitors emerge and fight for market share. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has recently turned to one of those unexpected competitors to source chips for its new AI-powered iPhones. One of the companies that has been developing its own chips is Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL). And Apple has been training its new AI system, called \"Apple Intelligence,\" using Alphabet's custom chips, according to a research paper. The company used two versions of Google's tensor processing unit to develop its AI models, which gives iPhone users access to generative AI features, including advanced writing tools, the ability to generate images, and a Siri assistant with \"all-new superpowers. \"Alphabet is a potentially strong competitor for Nvidia to worry about. The company has plenty of resources to work with. Last year, Alphabet generated more than $69 billion in free cash flow. It has been investing in its AI chatbot Gemini, and AI chips could provide it with yet another growth opportunity to pile money into. The courts recently found that the company's search engine, Google, has an illegal monopoly. And depending on what the consequences of that finding are, Alphabet may soon see a huge incentive to find a new growth opportunity to pursue, as the ruling may have a detrimental effect on a key part of its business. Beyond Alphabet, however, there are other competitors for Nvidia to worry about. Meta Platforms has been working on an AI chip of its own, as has Amazon. And investors also shouldn't forget about AMD, which is a more traditional rival for Nvidia. Although it has been late to the game, AMD has made it clear that AI is a big priority for the business, and it could also take away some sizable market share from Nvidia in the future. Nvidia has generated incredible gains due to its dominance in the AI chip space. And it is working on innovating and coming out with more advanced chips to ensure it remains on top. But maintaining such a large market share can be incredibly difficult, especially with so many big tech companies out there with deep pockets to contend with. They aren't simply going to ignore such a massive opportunity in AI chips. The company's revenue has taken off over the past year, with Nvidia's growth rate in recent quarters being well in excess of 200%. Those kinds of numbers, while extremely impressive, are also extremely difficult to maintain. At some point, Nvidia's growth rate will start to come down, especially if more competition emerges in the field. And its high-priced chips may also need to come down in price if that's the case, which may lead to both a slowing growth rate and smaller profit margins than the 50%-plus margins it has been averaging of late. Nvidia's stock has been giving back some gains in recent weeks, but it's still a top company to invest in if you want exposure to the red-hot AI market. While other companies may try to take market share from Nvidia, that doesn't mean that they will be able to do so overnight. Nvidia is still in an excellent position to continue growing, but I would expect its growth rate and margins to come down a bit in future quarters, especially as companies potentially reduce AI spending due to a possible economic slowdown. Nvidia's stock may struggle in the near term, but as long you're willing to hang on for the long term, it can still make for a good buy. Still, you should brace for some challenges ahead.

      "Investors waiting for a pullback in Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock may believe the opportunity has arrived. The stock has pulled back since peaking at just above $140 per share in June. Investors should also remember it has lost more than half of its value twice since 2018. However, the artificial intelligence (AI) stock is up nearly 2,400% over the last five years. Indeed, Nvidia has earned much of this growth thanks to its leadership in the AI chip space. But amid a sell-off in tech stocks, should investors start buying now or hold out for a lower stock price?Nvidia began as a gaming company and is involved in fields such as automotive and professional visualization. More recently, the stock has shot into the stratosphere thanks to its work in becoming the dominant company in the AI chip space. Although Advanced Micro Devices, Qualcomm, and others have offered competing products, Nvidia is the technical leader, dominating at least 80% of the market. Also, the $30,000 or more price tag for its AI chips is far above what its peers can command in this market. Still, as mentioned, the stock sold off in recent weeks. Besides a general sell-off in the tech sector, the Department of Justice has hit Nvidia with multiple investigations regarding its dominance in the AI chip sector, according to The Information. The same publication also reported that design flaws will delay the launch of its next-generation Blackwell AI chip. This may have a broader impact across the tech market as cloud providers such as Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft may count on this technology to deliver some of their productivity gains to investors. Admittedly, its financials may experience little direct impact. The AI chip market is expected to grow at a 38% compound annual growth rate through 2032, and Nvidia and its peers have struggled to keep up with demand. In the first quarter of fiscal 2025, Nvidia's revenue grew 262% to $26 billion. Also, while we will not know how it performs in fiscal Q2 until its August 28 earnings release, it expects $28 billion in quarterly revenue at the midpoint, which would amount to 107% yearly growth. Nvidia's problem is that its stock is arguably still priced for perfection, and the lawsuits and developmental delays indicate it falls short of that standard. Given its rapid growth, the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 59 may seem justified. However, other valuation metrics point to an expensive stock. Its 31 price-to-sales (P/S) ratio exceeds AMD's sales multiple of just over 9. Also, its 50 price-to-book value ratio is far above AMD's book value multiple of 4. Although Nvidia's technical lead calls for a premium, such levels seem excessive, considering Nvidia's challenges. When it comes to buying Nvidia, the answer may be both to buy now and hold out for a lower price. Here's why. Due to Nvidia's dominance in the AI chip market, revenue and profits will likely continue to rise rapidly, even with the delayed launch of the Blackwell chips. Thus, it will probably remain a long-term winner at just about any price. Still, investors should employ dollar-cost average (DCA) investing instead of purchasing all at once. Considering Nvidia's recent challenges and elevated multiples, the chances of a further near-term pullback are high. Also, as mentioned, Nvidia stock has lost more than 50% of its value twice since 2018. Hence, investors cannot rule out such a decline from happening again. DCA investing can serve as a compromise between owning Nvidia stock without denying oneself an opportunity to buy at a lower price.

Is the Stock Market Sell-Off a Reason to Buy Nvidia Stock? was originally published by The Motley Fool\n",
      "Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC) stock has been battered and beaten this month, and August has only just begun. The company's share price has plunged 34% since July 30 amid a sell-off affecting countless stocks. Growing fears of a recession and dismal earnings from Intel sent investors into a panic. While I firmly believe in holding through a market dip rather than selling a tech stock like Intel, it doesn't necessarily mean now is the time to buy more. The above chart shows that despite recent declines, Intel's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is significantly higher than other tech stocks. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) offer similar exposure to budding markets like artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing yet are trading at a better value than Intel. In addition to Intel's stock being poorly valued, its latest quarter (the second quarter of 2024) missed revenue and earnings-per-share (EPS) expectations. Meanwhile, recent earnings from AMD and Alphabet illustrate a positive growth trajectory. So forget Intel and consider buying these two millionaire-maker stocks instead. AMD's stock has tumbled 24% over the last month as tech stocks have fallen out of favor. However, the company boasts a long history of growth that has seen it create many millionaires, with its share price up more than 3,000% since 2014. The company has enjoyed immense success over the years, taking on a crucial role in the chip market. AMD's hardware powers products across tech, from game consoles like Sony's PlayStation 5 to consumer-built PCs, laptops, data centers, and AI models. As a result, AMD is easily one of the best stocks to gain exposure to different areas of tech. AMD's closest competitors are Nvidia and Intel, and the three companies are fierce rivals in AI chips. Nvidia dominates the industry, while Intel has yet to make real headway. However, recent earnings indicate AMD's AI division is on a promising growth path and gaining on Nvidia. In Q2 2024, AMD's revenue rose 9% year over year, beating expectations by $120 million. Meanwhile, earnings per share of $0. 69 outperformed estimates by $0. 01. The quarter benefited from a 115% year-over-year revenue increase in its AI-focused data center segment and a 49% rise in client sales. AMD's gaming segment suffered from reductions in semi-custom chip sales, with revenue falling 59%. However, that didn't stop solid growth in the quarter as the company pivoted its business toward AI. Operating income for the period hit $269 million, significantly improving on the $20 million in losses reported a year ago. AMD's Q2 2024 proves it's enjoying impressive returns on its hefty investment in AI and gaining in the industry. Its quarterly free cash flow has soared 81% year to date, increasing its spending power. In addition to being a better-valued stock, AMD is a no-brainer buy over Intel right now. Alphabet's share price has tumbled 17% since early July, in tandem with the tech sell-off. However, its forward P/E of 21 makes it one of the best-valued stocks in tech and too good to pass up. Meanwhile, like AMD, recent earnings hint at a lucrative future for the tech giant. The Google company reported its Q2 2024 earnings at the end of July, with revenue rising 14% year over year to $85 billion. The quarter saw solid growth in advertising, with sales increasing by 11%. However, Google Cloud delivered the most gains, with revenue soaring 28% year over year and beating competitors Amazon Web Services and Microsoft in cloud growth for the period. At the start of the year, Alphabet seemed to fall behind its cloud rivals, but earnings prove it's quickly catching up. In addition to impressive revenue growth, Google Cloud's operating income nearly tripled and hit more than $1 billion for the first time. Success in cloud computing is promising for Alphabet as it diversifies its earnings, allowing it to lean less on advertising and secure a promising role in AI. Alphabet has a long history of making people rich and undoubtedly created more than a few millionaires, with its stock up 470% over the last decade. With its bargain price, Alphabet's stock is worth picking up over Intel and is an excellent way to invest in tech.

      "The U. S. stock market has been very volatile in the past decade and has been influenced by factors such as economic releases, geopolitical tensions, and technological advancements. With the market constantly cycling through bull and bear phases, long-term investors need to pick stakes in stocks with sustainable competitive advantages. Companies that are flexible and resource-rich enough to adapt to changing market conditions fare better than those with rigid business models. With this in mind, let's look at the three stocks that should be at the top of a long-term investor's buying list. The first stock to add to your buy list is data mining and artificial intelligence (AI) specialist Palantir (NYSE: PLTR), a company known for its advanced capabilities to sift through huge mounds of unstructured and complex data and derive actionable insights for governments and enterprises. Historically, Palantir has been famous as a major technology vendor for government agencies, helping them thwart terrorist attacks and identify malicious actors. Recently though, the company's U. S. commercial business has also started picking up steam, mainly by increasing interest and adoption of its new product -- an artificial intelligence platform (AIP). In the first quarter of fiscal 2024, U. S. commercial revenue rose 40% year over year to $150 million, while U. S. commercial customer count increased 69% year over year to 262. AIP has also become a major growth catalyst, as it helps clients implement AI applications quickly and effectively. AIP can also work with the clients' messy and unstructured data to derive actionable outcomes. This is a major competitive advantage since competitors are generally able to work with only \"AI-ready\" data. With global data creation expected to grow over 180 zettabytes by 2025, Palantir is a solid buy since there are still many government agencies and companies that can benefit from its exceptional offerings. The second phenomenal stock in your buy list can be database specialist Oracle (NYSE: ORCL). The company is witnessing robust growth in its cloud business, especially Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). This has been mainly driven by explosive demand for AI-optimized data center infrastructure for training and inferencing large language models. Piper Sandler has also included Oracle in its \"highest conviction ideas\" despite the weakening macroeconomic environment. Oracle's cloud infrastructure is considered faster, more cost-effective, autonomous, and secure compared to competitors in running complex AI and machine learning workloads, particularly training and inferencing large language models. The company is constructing small, portable, and affordable data centers as well as massive data centers equipped with liquid cooling to manage the power-hungry and thermally intensive AI workloads. Oracle is thus benefiting dramatically from the long-term trend of enterprises migrating from on-premise infrastructure to the cloud. Oracle Cloud Services' remaining performance obligation (order backlog) grew by 44% year-over-year to $98 billion at the end of fiscal 2024 (ended March 31, 2024). Management expects revenue from cloud infrastructure services to grow year over year by more than 50% in fiscal 2025. The company is also guiding for double-digit percentage revenue growth in its fiscal 2025. Against this backdrop, with Oracle trading at just 17. 78 times forward earnings, it looks like a great bargain. The third stock in the list is the data streaming platform player Confluent (NASDAQ: CFLT). Although Confluent surpassed revenue and earnings estimates in the recent quarter (second quarter of fiscal 2024, which ended June 30, 2024), investors were disappointed with increasing volatility in consumption patterns for the company's services among its large digital native customers. While the company witnessed stable demand in the first quarter and healthy demand in the early second quarter, customers have been increasingly focusing on controlling short-term cloud costs in June 2024. This has affected the expansion of Confluent in new use cases. Confluent's share prices have plunged by over 25% since it came out with second-quarter fiscal 2024 earnings results. However, this pullback seems exaggerated, especially since Confluent is one of the leading players enabling enterprises to analyze and process data streams in real time. This is particularly important amid the increasing prevalence of AI and machine learning applications, which depend extensively on large amounts of real-time data flows. Confluent's data streaming platforms are already used in generative AI applications requiring contextual, secure, and trustworthy data streams, such as voice bots and personalized customer experience management. Confluent has almost completed its transition to a consumption-oriented business model and has added new capabilities such as stream processing, connectivity, and governance to its data platform. These moves have been quite successful, considering that the company added 320 new customers in the second quarter to reach a total customer count of around 5,440, the largest sequential growth in the past two years. Confluent has noted that the customers using both the cloud version and the platform version of its data streaming offerings are stickier and have a higher net retention rate (how much existing customers spend as compared to the previous year) than that of the overall company. Confluent can be a volatile stock and can fall even more amid the current uncertain macroeconomic environment. However, considering its solid growth catalysts and important role in the ongoing AI revolution, you can consider picking up at least a small stake in this compelling stock.

      "Investing. com -- Here are the biggest analyst moves in the area of artificial intelligence (AI) for this week. InvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today!New Street Research has upgraded NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) to a Buy rating with a target price of $120 this week. The move comes following a significant decline in the chipmaker’s stock since its June peak, leading Nvidia to underperform other semiconductor stocks linked to data center AI. “We find the correction healthy overall, recognize some limited and tactical headwinds specific to Nvidia, but overall see the stock moves as an opportunity to gain more exposure,” analysts said. The recent dip in Nvidia's shares has been partially attributed to reports of a potential three-month delay in the release of its Blackwell chip due to design flaws. This delay could push volume shipments to Q1 2025. Blackwell’s design features two large dies interconnected at 10TB/s using TSMC’s CoWoS-L packaging technology, which has faced ramp-up challenges and may require redesign. To address this delay, Nvidia might extend the lifecycle of its Hopper chip, which uses the more mature CoWoS-S packaging and can be produced more efficiently. Also, Nvidia could introduce a simplified version of the Blackwell chip with a single die, New Street explains. “While it would have lower performance than the dual-die Blackwell SKUs, it would still be an uplift vs. Hopper,” analysts noted. New Street also maintains a positive outlook on Nvidia’s market dominance in the data center XPU space. \"We see in-house XPUs doing well against GPUs and being deployed in millions across gigantic in-house captive markets,\" though they acknowledge AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) as a potential challenger. Moreover, expectations for hyperscaler capex in 2025 have risen, now forecasting 13% growth, with AI infrastructure capex projected to grow by at least 30%. This supports the firm’s forecast that AI semiconductor spending could increase by 50% annually. Mizuho analysts on Wednesday downgraded Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) stock from Outperform to Neutral and adjusted their price target to $22 from $36. The investment bank initially upgraded Intel in November 2023, driven by expectations of strong AI momentum and new products boosting PC and data center traction. However, nine months later, the outlook has changed. \"We were wrong—INTC has continued to lag its peers and is losing share in all key markets AI/DC/PC through 2025E,” analysts wrote. “We see INTC headwinds continuing, with execution risks on its product portfolio, and we're downgrading INTC to Neutral. \"The technology gap between Intel and its competitors has widened, and while there is long-term potential for foundry and 18A tailwinds, regaining lost leadership is likely to be challenging, Mizuho notes. Despite launching new products in Server (Sierra Forest/Granite Rapids), AI (Gaudi 3), and PC (Meteor Lake), Intel is losing market share in PCs and data centers, remains “a distant 3rd in merchant AI. ” Mizuho also cited internal challenges, including headcount reductions that could impact morale and execution. The decision to cut dividends has further weighed on investor sentiment toward the stock, analysts pointed out. Earlier in the week, Bank of America analysts cut their rating on Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) stock to Neutral from Buy following the company's report of worse-than-expected margins for the fiscal fourth quarter. Although Q4 revenue met both the firm's and street estimates, the gross margin of 11. 3% fell significantly short of the anticipated 13. 6%. SMCI stock fell 20% on Wednesday. The data center company's revenue guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 exceeded expectations, and its full fiscal 2025 revenue projection of $28 billion topped the consensus estimate of $23. 8 billion. However, BofA noted that Super Micro's gross margin is expected to gradually return to its typical range of 14-17% by the end of fiscal 2025, assuming improvements in manufacturing efficiencies, a better customer mix, and the launch of new platforms. “While the long-term benefit from AI remains intact, we move to a Neutral rating, from Buy, as we see the next several quarters remaining margin challenged as SMCI navigates a competitive pricing environment, delayed shipment of Blackwell GPU systems that require liquid-cooled racks (higher margin), and ongoing issues with component availability. ”Reflecting these headwinds, they also lowered their price objective for Super Micro Computer from $1,090 to $700, aligning with the broader sector trend where valuation multiples have seen a notable decline. Palantir (NYSE:PLTR) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) have announced a partnership this week to develop an integrated technology suite designed for the U. S. Defense and Intelligence Community. This collaboration will leverage Palantir's AI-powered platforms within Microsoft's government and classified clouds, enabling secure cloud, AI, and analytics capabilities. As part of the agreement, Palantir will deploy its full product suite, including Foundry, Gotham, Apollo, and AIP, on Microsoft's cloud platforms. This will allow government agencies to build AI tools for operational and logistical purposes, with hands-on experiences to test the technology. Also, Palantir will integrate Microsoft's Azure OpenAI Service into secure environments, combining cloud computing with advanced language models to support AI-driven operations in defense and intelligence. “With this marquee deal solidified and MSFT leveraging PLTR for AI and LLM capabilities to the US government, the company can now increase the pace of AI implementation while PLTR continues to accelerate AIP adoption within the federal sector,” Wedbush analysts commented. “We believe this will be a launching pad for the PLTR AIP story to hit the DOD (Department of Defense) and broader Beltway ecosystem over the next 12 to 18 months,” they added. Semiconductor stocks have seen a sharp decline recently, driven by macroeconomic challenges and disappointing earnings that fell short of high expectations. The downturn has been linked to slower-than-anticipated replenishment of analog inventories and potential risks from the automotive sector, which accounts for 14% of semiconductor demand. However, analysts at Citi remain optimistic about the sector, stressing that \"the main reasons we are positive – AI and memory strength – remain intact. \"Despite the recent drop, Citi continues to favor Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) as their top pick within the industry. They believe that \"it’s time to double down as the DRAM upturn should persist given reduced capacity and DRAM pricing in 3Q24 is better than expected. \"The DRAM market is showing signs of improvement, with strong performances from major players like Samsung (KS:005930) and SK Hynix. Citi analysts have revised their forecast for 2024 DRAM pricing, now expecting a 62% year-over-year increase, up from their previous estimate of 53%. This adjustment is attributed to limited supply growth and a shift by memory makers towards high-bandwidth memory (HBM). While there are weaknesses in the automotive and industrial sectors, the demand from the largest end markets – PCs, handsets, and servers, which collectively represent 61% of semiconductor demand – remains relatively strong. Micron has reported that inventory levels in the traditional data center market improved during the first half of 2024 and anticipates further growth in the second half. Citi analysts have also indicated that they \"expect upside to guidance when Micron reports earnings in September. ”Micron saw its shares slump more than 30% over the past month.

      "Shares of Palantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR) were rallying after the company once again reported accelerating revenue growth and increased its full-year guidance. With the stock now up almost 70% year to date, let's take a closer look at the company's second-quarter results and whether it's too late to buy the stock. For the fourth-consecutive quarter, Palantir saw its year-over-year revenue growth accelerate to 27%, up from just 13% in the prior-year period. Breaking the top line down by segment, commercial revenue climbed 33% to $307 million, led by a 55% surge in U. S. commercial revenue to $159 million. Excluding strategic commercial contracts, commercial revenue jumped 40% with U. S. commercial revenue increasing 70%. The company added 33 net new customers in its U. S. commercial business during the quarter. Palantir's Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) continues to be the primary growth driver in its U. S. commercial business. The company said its \"Bootcamps\" remain its primary go-to-market strategy, but its biggest opportunity is moving from prototype to production with its customers. International commercial revenue rose 15% to $148 million but fell 1% sequentially. The company said it continues to see headwinds in Europe, but it was capitalizing on opportunities in Asia and the Middle East. On the government side of the business, revenue grew 23% to $371 million. U. S. government revenue jumped 24% year over year and 8% sequentially to $278 million. That was a nice improvement from the 12% year-over-year growth it saw last quarter. International government revenue, meanwhile, grew 21% year over year and 18% sequentially to $93 million. The company said it won several notable contracts in the quarter. This included one from the Department of Defense (DoD) Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office to deploy an AI-enabled operating system across the DoD, as well as another contract to allow third parties and government developers to develop applications and integrations on top of its Maven platform. Palantir once again increased its full-year revenue guidance. It now expects revenue within a range of $2. 742 billion to $2. 750 billion. That's above its prior outlook of $2. 677 billion to $2. 689 billion. Management's original full-year guidance had revenue falling between $2. 652 billion and $2. 668 billion. The company also raised its full-year adjusted operating-income forecast again, taking it to a range of $966 million to $974 million. That's significantly higher than the initial outlook of $834 million to $850 million. For Q3, it expects revenue to come in between $697 million and $701 million, while adjusted income from operations reaches $233 million to $237 million. One of the biggest issues surrounding Palantir stock previously was the fact its growth did not match its lofty valuation. However, its streak of top-line acceleration and increased guidance has brought the valuation down. Trading at a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of about 17. 5 as of this writing, the stock is still quite expensive. AIP continues to hold a lot of promise and clearly is resonating with its U. S. commercial customers. Its Bootcamp strategy is working, and its starting to move customers from prototype to production. At the same time, its U. S. government business has also been seeing some nice improvement as well. Currently, the company's guidance implies between 25% and 26% revenue growth next quarter, but if Palantir can beat its Q3 revenue guidance like it did last quarter, growth would land around 30%. The company's valuation suddenly looks a lot less pricey if it can sustain growth at such levels. At this point, it's not too late to buy Palantir stock for long-term investors. That said, I'd still prefer a less expensive valuation. As such, I'd be more inclined to be a buyer on a market pullback.

      "Arguably, the most important secular tailwind to emerge since early last year has been the rapid adoption of artificial intelligence (AI). This is causing an ongoing paradigm shift in business as companies figure out how best to benefit from these next-generation algorithms. What sets generative AI apart from its predecessors is its versatility. These AI systems can be used to generate images, create stories, summarize data, and create presentations, all with a few simple prompts. Additionally, its ability to find patterns in data and streamline rote and time-consuming tasks is being heralded as the \"fourth industrial revolution\" and could dramatically alter how business gets done. Managers everywhere are working to secure their share of the potential windfall. Now, enterprise software and cloud titan Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and AI and data analytics pioneer Palantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR) have joined forces to develop cutting-edge AI solutions for the U. S. government. In a press release on Thursday, Palantir and Microsoft announced an expansion of their existing partnership to \"bring some of the most sophisticated and secure cloud, AI, and analytics capabilities to the U. S. Defense and Intelligence Community. \"The goal of the partnership is to create a \"first-of-its-kind, integrated suite of technology\" featuring Microsoft's Azure Cloud and OpenAI services and Palantir's Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) in the government's secure cloud. By joining forces, Palantir will deploy Gotham, Foundry, Apollo, and AIP to Microsoft's Azure Government, Government Secret, and Top Secret Cloud platforms. Palantir will also adopt Azure's OpenAI service in these secure cloud environments. The resulting integrated solution will allow government users to build AI systems for a variety of applications, including logistics, contracting, prioritization, action planning, and more. What sets this agreement apart is the inclusion of Palantir's AIP. Management found that many users are reluctant to take the AI plunge because they simply don't know where to begin. The company began hosting boot camps or sessions that pair users with Palantir engineers to create these systems to solve real-world issues. The program has been wildly successful, with many customers signing sizable contracts within days or weeks of attending a boot camp session. That strategy could work equally well for government users. Both Palantir and Microsoft have made a name for themselves in the fast-growing field of AI. The success of Palantir's aforementioned strategy has been evident in its recent results. In the second quarter, revenue of $678 million grew 27% year over year, and Palantir generated a profit for a seventh consecutive quarter -- but there was much more going on under the hood. The company's government revenue -- which tends to be lumpy -- grew 23% year over year, while commercial revenue grew 33%. This was fueled by the U. S. commercial segment, which has become Palantir's fastest-growing business, with revenue that surged 83% year over year and is now expected to grow at least 47% in 2024. The engine behind that growth has been AIP. Palantir recently revealed it has hosted boot camps for more than 1,025 organizations over the past year, far exceeding its original plans for 500. The results have been stunning, as Palantir provided multiple examples of seven-figure deals signed within days or weeks of boot camp completion. This helps illustrate just how successful this novel strategy has been. For its part, Microsoft was quick to adopt generative AI and developed Copilot, a suite of AI-powered assistants designed to simplify and streamline time-consuming administrative tasks. In its fiscal 2024 fourth quarter (ended June 30), Microsoft said the number of people who use Copilot at work more than doubled quarter over quarter. This helped fuel robust growth as revenue of $64. 7 billion grew 15% year over year, while earnings per share (EPS) of $2. 95 grew 10%. Microsoft's biggest growth driver was its intelligent cloud segment, which grew 19% year over year and now represents 44% of total income. At the heart of the segment is Azure Cloud, which grew 29%. The company also noted that eight points of that growth were the result of AI services. Microsoft also said demand continued to outpace \"our available capacity. \" It's worth noting that Microsoft's cloud growth continues to outpace that of its rivals, with much of the credit going to AI. This helps to illustrate that Palantir and Microsoft are both profiting from the massive opportunity of generative AI, even as rivals lag behind. One of the more intriguing prospects of this partnership is the complementary capabilities of these two AI superstars and the large number of applications the collaboration will enable. Microsoft's government-approved secure cloud will play host to Palantir's decades of AI expertise and its cutting-edge AIP. Furthermore, Palantir's boot camp strategy might attract users and use cases that might otherwise be missed. Given their growth prospects and the opportunity to profit from AI, each of these stocks represents a compelling opportunity. Microsoft is currently selling for 30 times forward earnings, just a slight premium to the multiple of 28 for the S&P 500. At 82 times forward earnings, Palantir might seem prohibitively expensive, but those metrics don't take into account the company's accelerating growth. Using the forward price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio provides a more accurate picture, revealing a multiple of 0. 3 -- when any number less than 1 suggests an undervalued stock. This deal benefits both partners across the spectrum of their AI offerings. Microsoft gets to leverage Palantir's existing AI partnerships with U. S. government agencies, while Palantir benefits from the expansion of those existing revenue streams, as well as the accelerated adoption of AIP within the defense and intelligence communities. As such, this deal could actually rise to the level of game-changer, but only time will tell.

      "The adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) promises to add tremendous value to the economy by increasing worker productivity, accelerating product development, and providing a greater variety of services for consumers and businesses. It spells a lucrative opportunity for investors, with Statista projecting the AI market to increase fourfold to $826 billion by 2030. Here are two profitable AI software companies that should be relatively safe bets for the next 10 years. Palantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR) is a leading AI software builder that is used by major corporations and the U. S. government. Its latest financial results continue to point to a large opportunity that could deliver handsome returns to shareholders. After experiencing a slowdown in growth amid macroeconomic headwinds last year, the company is starting to see accelerating revenue again. Revenue grew 27% year over year in the second quarter, driven by balanced growth from commercial deals and the government. Organizations are spending more money with Palantir because it helps them improve operating efficiency and quicken the time to market with new products, all while keeping their data secure. Palantir distinguishes itself from competitors by targeting projects where it adds the most value, such as expensive and complex projects that other companies are unwilling to tackle. Palantir is building deep relationships with customers, and this is most evident in its strong growth with the government. In the second quarter, Palantir's U. S. government business grew 8% over the previous quarter and 24% year over year. Importantly, Palantir is becoming a very profitable business, which is also helping it stand out. Its adjusted free-cash-flow margin relative to revenue has increased from 15% in Q4 2022 to 22% in the most recent quarter. While there will be winners and losers in the AI market, Palantir's growing revenue and free cash flow show it will be one of the winners. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is the 800-pound gorilla in software, with millions of users who use Windows, Office, and LinkedIn every day, in addition to its cloud service business for enterprise. Its large installed base of users will be valuable as it looks to transform and profit off implementing AI features across the business. Revenue for Office 365 commercial grew 13% year over year in the June-ending fiscal fourth quarter, driven partly by Copilot for Microsoft 365. The number of people using Copilot for work nearly doubled quarter over quarter. But AI will also lead to new categories of products that could benefit Microsoft's consumer business over the long term. Microsoft recently unveiled new Copilot+ PCs, which bring several AI enhancements to the user experience. Wall Street is mostly bullish on Microsoft because of the growth opportunity in the Azure cloud business, which is the second-largest cloud services provider. Revenue from Azure and other cloud services grew 29% year over year last quarter, with AI services contributing 8 percentage points to growth. This contribution from AI is higher than in previous quarters, suggesting Microsoft is gaining momentum in the AI market. Microsoft will be one of the safest AI stocks to hold for the long term. It is a financial powerhouse with $74 billion in trailing free cash flow on $245 billion of revenue. It has the cash resources to invest in innovative new technologies while delivering growing streams of free cash flow to fuel shareholder returns.

      "While the COVID-19 pandemic is an increasingly distant memory for most investors, Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) has struggled to move past the overhang of record vaccine sales and earnings in 2021 and 2022. The stock is down about 53% from its all-time high as the market wonders whether the pharmaceutical giant can find its next blockbuster drug. The good news is that the company's latest results highlighted a growth rebound. Sales momentum from several recent product launches supports an improving outlook. Could Pfizer stock -- which currently has a compelling dividend yield of 5. 8% -- make a good addition to your portfolio now? Here's what you need to know. The challenge for Pfizer right now is to rebuild investor confidence with evidence that its long-term strategy is back on track. Fortunately, the company's second-quarter earnings (for the period ended June 30) have worked to move in that direction. Revenue growth turned positive, up 3% year over year, but an even more impressive 14% higher excluding the impact of the declining Comirnaty and Paxlovid COVID-19 programs. In addition to contributions from Seagen, which Pfizer acquired in late 2023, growth this quarter was driven by strong demand for flagship products like Vyndaqel and Eliquis. Sales of Nurtec as an acute migraine medication have also picked up. A major theme for Pfizer has been its effort to generate financial efficiencies through cost realignment, with a plan to deliver at least $4 billion in savings by the end of the year. It appears the effort is paying off. Second-quarter adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0. 60 came in $0. 14 ahead of the average Wall Street estimate. This allowed management to hike full-year guidance: Pfizer now expects 2024 adjusted EPS of between $2. 45 and $2. 65, compared to a prior $2. 25 midpoint estimate. The revenue forecast was also bumped higher to a range of $59. 5 billion to $62. 5 billion, for a 4% increase at the midpoint over 2023. The market typically rewards a turnaround story, and Pfizer has all the pieces in place to emerge stronger after a difficult couple of years. The attraction of the stock as an investment opportunity starts with its sector leadership and recognized history of innovation. What I like about Pfizer is its compelling value, with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 11 times management's 2024 EPS guidance. Pfizer also offers one of the highest dividend yields among a peer group of global drugmakers -- currently at 5. 8%, based on its $0. 42-per-share quarterly payout. This level is well above names like AbbVie with a 3. 3% yield, GSK at 3. 8%, or even Bristol Myers Squibb at 5. 1%. The takeaway from the second-quarter earnings report is that the company is finally turning the page on its volatile later-pandemic era. I believe shares of Pfizer deserve a buy rating. Multiple drug programs pending clinical study readouts are expected through the end of this year, covering weight management, oncology, and hematology. These therapeutic candidates could be catalysts for the stock to rally higher. At the same time, those regulatory decisions are also risks to consider, with any setback in Pfizer's pipeline likely adding volatility to the stock. Ultimately, Pfizer looks undervalued, considering the long-term opportunities across its existing portfolio and drug pipeline. The company's ability to reclaim a profitable growth trajectory should be positive for shares. For investors with a long-term time horizon, Pfizer could be a good choice in the context of a diversified portfolio.

      "It's been an exciting, if sometimes uncertain, year for the business of GLP-1s. Just have a look at the past week. On Wednesday, Novo Nordisk (NVO) missed second quarter Wall Street estimates for its GLP-1 sales, reflecting ongoing supply constraints of weight-loss drug Wegovy. The stock slipped 7% on the news. But on Thursday, Eli Lilly (LLY) blew past Wall Street estimates for its GLP-1 sales. It beat Wall Street quarterly sales projections by 13% — with total sales of $4. 3 billion for weight-loss drug Zepbound and diabetes drug Mounjaro. The stock surged more than 10% on Thursday as a result of Lilly signaling the easing of supply constraints helped Novo too. Its stock rose 5% that day. In the background, there are other competing candidates inching towards their market debuts. Tema ETFs founder and CEO Maurits Pot told Yahoo Finance that the market will soon, for instance, include multiple players. \"We think actually over time this is going to be a four-to-six-horse race because right now you only have one device which is injectable going after one treatment, which is weight loss. But we're seeing innovation in parts of the market where we're looking at people looking at oral instead of injectable. People are looking at applications beyond weight loss,\" Pot said. Which is why some say market moves based on quarterly results in the near term isn't a good strategy. \"Lilly is a reminder that it's silly to look at either of these names on a 90-day basis when the market is north of $100 billion,\" Jared Holz, healthcare sector expert at Mizuho, told Yahoo Finance. But it's exactly that large market potential that is keeping investors on edge. \"At the end of the day, it is still the most meaningful market in dollars in all of pharma and biotech,\" he said. That all said, here's where some of the industry players stand after reporting second quarter earnings:Novo Nordisk: Despite the miss in Wegovy sales, Denmark-based Novo remains the market leader with its share of the GLP-1 market. CEO Lars Jørgensen said the company has 69% of the market share globally, and diabetes drug Ozempic specifically leads with a 46% share. The company also got approval for Wegovy for patients at risk of heart disease. But it could cede its lead after delaying an FDA filing to treat heart failure with GLP-1s until early next year. Competitor Lilly reiterated its guidance to file this year. Eli Lilly: Lilly's weight-loss drug Zepbound completed its second full quarter on the market and has zoomed into blockbuster territory at a greater clip than any of the other three new GLP-1s on the market — all while faced with supply constraints and lack of coverage by large employers and the federal government. It has now filed with the FDA to get approval for Zepbound to treat sleep apnea, which could change the coverage hurdle. Meanwhile, Lilly's drugs came off the FDA shortage list, and it launched in a handful of new global markets. The company is also focused on getting its oral version, orforglipron, to market to help increase access and broaden options for patients. Pfizer: Pfizer (PFE) is no longer seen as a near-term threat after it faced a setback with its oral GLP-1 candidate, danuglipron. The company had to nix its twice-daily pill and opt to test once-daily doses, which are still in mid-stage trials. The company could still get a piece of the pie, though, as demand will continue to outstrip supply. Roche: The Swiss-based company (RHHBY) bet nearly $3 billion on a biotech, Carmot Therapeutics, and acquired a few GLP-1 candidates as a result. The investment is already providing a return. Both an injectable and an oral candidate in early-stage trials are showing promise with comparable weight loss to the current market leaders. That gives the Big Pharma company a chance to invest in and advance candidates more efficiently than if they were still under the biotech brand. The deal closed at the start of this year. Amgen: One of the most promising and differentiated candidates advancing through trials is Amgen's (AMGN) MariTide. It could be used less frequently (once monthly) than the current once-weekly GLP-1 injectables. It also has a similar weight-loss profile to the current market leaders. It's already in phase II clinical trials but poised to enter the final stage, phase III, sometime in the near future. CFO Peter Griffith told Yahoo Finance the company is gearing up for more studies on obesity-related diseases as well. So far this year, the company has increased its research and development budget by 30%. Viking: Viking Therapeutics (VKTX), the Swiss-based biotech, has had quite a year. Its stock so far in 2024 is up more than 200%, thanks to promising results for its oral pill. Viking, as a result, could also be an acquisition target, according to Mizuho's Holz. That's because it is now competing with big players, which can invest in drug trials at a much quicker pace. Even if Viking were to be acquired at a 100% premium, it would still be a deal for an acquirer, Holz said. Consider that the daily moves in the market for both Lilly and Novo are multiples higher than the total market value of Viking, he said. Hims & Hers: The telehealth and mail order delivery platform (HIMS) is a different kind of player in the weight-loss craze. While it is not a maker of the injectables, it is planning to buy a compounding pharmacy in order to continue its offerings of GLP-1s — which is allowed by the FDA for drugs on the shortage list. The company only recently decided to start offering the drugs after only being in the support business for patients. In the second quarter, the company reported $16 million in revenue from GLP-1 sales. But once the shortage of branded GLP-1s ends, the future is uncertain. CFO Yemi Okupe told Yahoo Finance that the company was already seeing an increase in business prior to adding the GLP-1s. But adding them has given Hims a boost. Hims remains one to watch because it and other similar platforms offer these services for cash rather than through insurance, which signals the level of demand for the products as insurers continue to avoid coverage.

      "Many investors define successful investing as beating the market average over the long term. But its virtually certain that sometimes you will buy stocks that fall short of the market average returns. We regret to report that long term Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) shareholders have had that experience, with the share price dropping 41% in three years, versus a market return of about 14%. The last week also saw the share price slip down another 6. 2%. Importantly, this could be a market reaction to the recently released financial results. You can check out the latest numbers in our company report. With the stock having lost 6. 2% in the past week, it's worth taking a look at business performance and seeing if there's any red flags. Check out our latest analysis for Pfizer To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price. Pfizer saw its share price decline over the three years in which its EPS also dropped, falling to a loss. This was, in part, due to extraordinary items impacting earnings. Since the company has fallen to a loss making position, it's hard to compare the change in EPS with the share price change. However, we can say we'd expect to see a falling share price in this scenario. The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers). Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here. As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for Pfizer the TSR over the last 3 years was -33%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!While the broader market gained around 19% in the last year, Pfizer shareholders lost 16% (even including dividends). However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 1. 4%, each year, over five years. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. To that end, you should be aware of the   2 warning signs  we've spotted with Pfizer . Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of companies we expect will grow earnings.

      "Are you eager to improve your passive income stream with dividend-paying stocks? If so, finding high-yield options is easier now than it was just a few weeks ago. The S&P 500 reached a new peak on July 16, and it's been mostly downhill since. When the U. S. market closed on Aug. 7, the benchmark index was about 8. 3% below its recent peak. A stock market sell-off isn't great for the performance of stocks already in your portfolio, but it's creating opportunities to buy shares of terrific dividend-paying businesses at a relative discount. At recent prices, Pfizer (NYSE: PFE), PennantPark Floating Rate Capital (NYSE: PFLT), and Ares Capital (NASDAQ: ARCC) offer an 8. 9% yield on average. That means an initial investment of $11,300 spread evenly among them is enough to set yourself up with $1,000 of dividend income over the next 12 months. Plus, there's a good chance that these well-managed businesses can raise their payouts in the years ahead. With patent-protected market exclusivity for innovative new medicines, drugmakers tend to produce profits and pay dividends that grow reliably. Pfizer has raised its dividend payout every year since 2009; at recent prices, it offers a 5. 8% dividend yield. Sales of Pfizer's COVID-19 products fell faster than expected but not before the company reinvested heaps of the revenue they generated back into its development pipeline. For example, the pharma giant acquired Seagen, a cancer drug developer in late 2023 for about $43 billion. The Seagen acquisition gave Pfizer access to four commercial-stage drugs, including Padcev. Last December, Padcev became a new treatment option for newly diagnosed bladder cancer patients. Pfizer reported second-quarter revenue from Seagen products that reached an annualized $3. 4 billion, which was 55% more than Seagen reported in the previous-year period. Marketed drugs gaining ground raised total Q2 revenue by 14% year over year if COVID-19 products are excluded. In addition to all the drugs it currently sells, Pfizer boasted over a dozen new medicines in phase 3 clinical trials as of July 30. With heaps of experimental drugs in its pipeline and plenty of resources to market them, Pfizer could keep raising its dividend payout for another 15 years. PennantPark Floating Rate Capital is a business development company (BDC). For decades, America's largest banks have stepped back from lending directly to mid-sized businesses. BDCs are essentially lenders to middle-market businesses which are often willing to pay through the nose for access to capital. Income-seeking investors like BDCs because they have to distribute nearly everything they earn to investors as a dividend. PennantPark Floating Rate Capital makes monthly dividend payments and offers a huge 11. 4% yield at recent prices. About 87% of PennantPark's portfolio consists of first-lien debt, which is first to be repaid in the unlikely event of bankruptcy. In Q2, the BDC reported a 12. 1% weighted-average yield on its debt investments. Generally, BDCs perform well right up until unexpected economic downturns ruin their borrowers' ability to make ends meet. With a brief exception in 2018, this BDC has been able to maintain or raise its dividend payout since 2011. There are no guarantees, but investors can reasonably look forward to steady dividend payments for many more years. Among the 151 companies it's lent money to, just three representing 1. 5% of its portfolio at cost were on non-accrual status at the end of June. Ares Capital is another BDC with a respectable dividend payout-raising track record. Its quarterly payment hasn't grown in a straight line, but it is up by 60% since the company began paying dividends in 2005. At recent prices, the stock offers a 9. 5% yield. With a portfolio valued at $25 billion, Ares Capital is the biggest publicly traded BDC you can buy shares of and one of the most stable. At the end of June, just 1. 5% of total investments at cost were on non-accrual status. Macroeconomic pressures could cause Ares Capital to lower its dividend payout in the years ahead, but it would need to be a disastrous downturn. Over the past 12 months, this BDC's average borrower reported earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) that was 1. 6 times their interest expenses. Nearly all of PennantPark Floating Rate Capital's borrowers pay interest at variable rates, but Ares Capital is a little more flexible. Only 69% of its portfolio collects interest at floating rates, which could be an advantage if the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates later this year. Adding some shares of this BDC to a diverse portfolio is a great way for most income-seeking investors to boost their passive income stream.

      "U. S. stock markets have rebounded from last week’s devastations. The Wall Street rally, which started in January 2023, saw a significant change in July 2024. The rally was predominantly driven by the technology sector. An unprecedented adoption of generative artificial intelligence (AI) technology globally was the prime factor. Companies that have extensive applications of AI in their final products have become multi-baggers in the past 18 months. Stock prices of some of these companies have skyrocketed 200-300% during this period. Meanwhile, market participants have other sectors to look into. As expectations for a rate cut in September reached 100%, investors’ preferences shifted from these extremely overvalued AI stocks to the rate-sensitive cyclical stocks. Aside from technology stocks, several old economy stocks from sectors such as industrials, finance, auto, materials and consumer defensive have popped in the past six months. Investing in these untapped stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank should lead to profits. We have narrowed our search to five old economy stocks that have provided more returns than the market’s benchmark — the S&P 500 Index — in the past six months. Despite this, these stocks have solid near-term potential. Moreover, these stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 30 days. Each of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. The chart below shows the price performance of our five picks in the past six months. Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNewmont Corp. NEM is making notable progress with its growth projects, including the Tanami expansion. The acquisition of Newcrest has also created an industry-leading portfolio with a multi-decade gold and copper production profile in the most favorable mining jurisdictions globally. The combination of NEM and Newcrest is expected to deliver significant value for shareholders and generate meaningful synergies. NEM also focuses on improving operational efficiency and returning value to shareholders. Higher gold prices will also drive NEM’s performance. Strong demand from central banks, a dovish Fed interest rate outlook and a surge in safe-haven demand triggered by geopolitical tensions have contributed to a rally in gold prices. Zacks Rank #1 Newmont has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 42. 5% and 71. 4%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter and current-year earnings have improved 7. 9% and 14. 5%, respectively, over the last 60 days. Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe stock price has jumped 45. 5% in the past six months. Despite this huge price appreciation, the average price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 10. 6% from the last closing price of $47. 71. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $42. 70-$59. GE Aerospace GE has been witnessing strength in its Aerospace business, driven by robust demand for commercial engines and services. Rising U. S. & international defense budgets, geopolitical tensions, positive airline & airframer dynamics and robust demand for commercial air travel auger well for GE. GE’s portfolio reshaping actions are likely to unlock values for its shareholders. GE remains committed to making investments to boost growth and provide better services to its customers. For 2024, GE expects organic revenues to grow at least in the low-double-digit range from the year-ago levels. Zacks Rank #1 GE Aerospace has an expected earnings growth rate of 47. 7% for the current year. Although its revenue growth rate is negative for the current year, it is 14% for next year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter and current-year earnings have improved 7. 8% and 4. 3%, respectively, over the last 60 days. Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe stock price has surged 18. 9% in the past six months. The average price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 21. 6% from the last closing price of $165. 61. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $180-$215. Pfizer Inc. PFE expects better non-COVID operational revenue growth in the future quarters, driven by its in-line products like Vyndaqel and Prevnar, new launches like Abrysvo, Velsipity, Penbraya and newly acquired products, including those acquired from Seagen. Huge profits from its COVID products strengthened PFE’s cash position. The funds are being used to make acquisitions, increase dividends, buy back shares and reduce debt. PFE has committed significant resources toward the development of treatments in the fields of oncology, internal medicine, rare diseases, immunology, inflammation, vaccines and hospitals. For the near future, PFE has drafted a robust mRNA strategy where it is investing in mRNA technology and collaborationsZacks Rank #2 Pfizer has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 5. 3% and 39. 7%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter and current-year earnings have improved 8. 8% and 8%, respectively, over the last 60 days.

The average price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 14. 8% from the last closing price of $28. 76. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $27-$45. The Progressive Corp. PGR continues to gain on higher premiums, given its compelling product portfolio, leadership position and strength in both Vehicle and Property businesses. Focus on becoming a one-stop insurance destination, catering to customers opting for a combination of home and auto insurance, augurs well for PGR’s growth. Policies in force and retention ratio should remain healthy. Competitive pricing to retain current customers and address their needs with new offerings should continue to drive policy life expectancy. Zacks Rank #2 The Progressive has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 19. 5% and 96. 7%, respectively, for the current year.

Boston Scientific Corp. BSX is seeing strength across target markets despite macroeconomic concerns, currency headwinds and related cost inflation. Strong worldwide demand for its Electrophysiology and Structural Heart lines, traction in the United States and outside for BSX’s next-generation WATCHMAN FLX and FLX Pro, as well as contribution from accretive acquisitions are important drivers. The Pain and Brain franchisees of BSX are expected to gain solid traction in 2024 banking on the strong execution of core growth strategies. The Electrophysiology arm continues to gain momentum on the sustained adoption of FARAPULSE PFA. BSX’s 2024 guidance indicates strong growth over 2023Zacks Rank #2 Boston Scientific has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 14. 2% and 17. 1%, respectively, for the current year.

      "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best GLP-1 and Weight Loss Stocks to Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) stands against the other GLP-1 and weight loss stocks. According to WHO, more than one billion people worldwide are obese, including 650 million adults, 340 million adolescents, and 39 million children. A brand-new class of weight-loss drugs that don't require diets or intense exercise appears to be revolutionary. With the help of these revolutionary drugs, overweight and obese individuals can reduce their body weight by 15% to 20%. \"This could be the biggest opportunity that we've ever seen in the pharma industry,\" says Andy Acker, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson Investors. Without question, weight-loss drugs are popular. Investors are comparing the US weight-loss medicine pioneer, to the leader in artificial intelligence chips. Morgan Stanley Research, in light of this surge in demand, now projects that the global obesity drugs market will reach $105 billion in 2030, up from a previous estimate of $77 billion. In 2023, branded obesity drugs generated $6 billion in sales. In 2023, the obesity drug market leader Semaglutide (the generic name for Ozempic, Wegovy, and Rybelsus) was the most prescribed Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 GLP-1 agonist , accounting for more than 88% of all new prescriptions, as per Forbes. The only GLP-1 drugs for weight control that have FDA approval to date are tirzepatide, liraglutide, and semaglutide. J. P. Morgan Research estimates that the GLP-1 market will reach $100 billion by 2030, fueled equally by diabetes and obesity. By 2030, there may be 30 million GLP-1 users in the United States, or around 9% of the total population. The growing demand for obesity medications will have a wide-ranging impact, benefiting sectors such as biotech while generating headwinds for others, including food and beverage. Chris Schott, a Senior Analyst covering the U. S. Diversified Biopharma sector stated:“GLP-1s have been used to treat T2D since 2005, starting with the approval of Byetta, with follow-on products continually improving on efficacy. The most recent, Ozempic and Mounjaro, offer significant advantages over previous products and have accelerated class growth,” “Indeed, the newest generations of GLP-1s and combos lead to 15-25+% weight loss on average, well above prior generations of products. ”Regarding the treatment of obesity, some are hailing the newest generation of GLP-1 medications as \"miracle drugs. \" However, not everyone with obesity can use GLP-1s due to their high cost and restricted insurance coverage. According to Jonathan Gruber, Professor of Economics and Chairman of the Economics Department at MIT, if 40% of Americans with obesity took these treatments at present pricing (about $15,000 per person), the annual cost would exceed $1 trillion. This nearly equals the amount of money the government spends on the whole Medicare program. That's an astounding number, then. Over the past ten years, the usage of GLP-1 drugs, such as semaglutide, for weight loss has doubled, but among those with type 2 diabetes, its use has decreased by almost 10%, according to research published on Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine. The prolonged medication scarcity that followed, the researchers caution, may restrict the medications' accessibility to those with diabetes. Dr. Yee Hui Yeo, a clinical fellow in the Karsh Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology at Cedars-Sina, highlighted that as demand for obesity medications rises, it is critical to guarantee that diabetic patients have access to GLP-1 medicines. The FDA claims that the shortages are the result of rising demand. Not only do the shortages impact the United States: The European Medicines Agency cautioned that the GLP-1 drug shortage is a \"major public health concern\" that is unlikely to be remedied in 2024. People with diabetes have struggled to obtain their prescriptions due to shortages, with some limiting their drugs to manage, according to NPR. The experts on the panel \"Weighing the Future of Obesity Drugs,\" including Debra Netschert of Jennison Investments, Julia Angeles of Baillie Gifford, and Gentry Lee of Fayez Serofim, discussed the potential of GLP-1 drugs, which were initially developed for treating diabetes but are now being used to treat obesity. Netschert emphasized the progression of GLP-1 medication delivery, ranging from weekly dosages to several daily injections, as well as continuous attempts to reduce injection frequency further and minimize adverse reactions. Netschert pointed out that 1. 5 million out of the 110 million eligible patients in the United States are currently undergoing treatment with GLP-1 drugs, despite their outstanding performance, because of production limitations. Netschert and Angeles argued over who pays the expense, with Angeles claiming that the majority of patients pay out of pocket while Netschert cited considerable reimbursement from Medicare/Medicaid and insurance. Netschert stated that outside the borders of the United States, these drugs may be needed by as many as 700 million individuals worldwide. Notably, the panel discovered that U. K. payors, who are typically strict, authorized GLP-1 drugs faster than any other country, highlighting their perceived value. The obesity drugs market is a high-growth industry and since it's in its early innings, now may be a time to add some weight loss stocks to your watchlists. Our MethodologyWe sifted through holdings of weight loss ETFs and online rankings to form an initial list of 20 weight loss and GLP-1 stocks.

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 77                                                             Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) is a global company that finds, develops, produces, promotes, distributes, and sells biopharmaceutical pharmaceuticals in Europe and the US. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) recently confirmed that it will proceed with the development of danuglipron, an oral tablet that acts as a GLP-1 agonist and is used to treat weight reduction. This action is a result of the twice-daily formulation's Phase 2 trial meeting effectiveness targets despite a high rate of patient withdrawals owing to adverse effects. A notable improvement is that there is no indication of liver damage with the once-daily form of danuglipron. Pfizer is still lagging behind the two market leaders, which have drugs like Zepbound and Wegovy dominating the weight loss market. Pfizer's new formulation strives to meet obesity's common medical demands, but it is up against numerous other candidates in clinical trials. Pfizer reported $14. 9 billion in revenue in the first quarter of 2024, a 19% decrease from the previous year. Adjusted EPS was $0. 82, whereas reported EPS was $0. 55. The company's other revenues increased by 11%, while COVID-related revenue decreased. Only over $1 billion of Pfizer's revenue came from its massive M&A activity in Q1 2024, which included purchases worth close to $70 billion. The company estimates that over time, M&A will bring in $25 billion, while newly introduced items will bring in $20 billion. Pfizer's weight loss pill portfolio is being expanded in the competitive GLP-1 market by studying two other pills along with danuglipron. Over time, the launch of these therapies may have an effect on key market players' revenue growth. Tirzepatide (Mounjaro and Zepbound) and Semaglutide (Ozempic and Wegovy), which are now dominating the weight loss market, have established high standards, with tirzepatide demonstrating a mean weight reduction of around 21% and semaglutide ~15%. Danuglipron, marketed by Pfizer, comes up against competition from existing competitors as well as firms that are creating GLP-1 agonists. As per analysts, PFE has a consensus Buy rating. In the first quarter of 2024, 77 hedge funds out of 920 reported holding a stake in Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE). Paul Cantor, Joseph Weiss, and Will Wurm's Beech Hill Partners is the largest shareholder in the company, with 102,788 shares worth $66. 995 million. In summary, Pfizer is still a distant rival in the crowded GLP-1 market, despite its encouraging focus on a once-daily danuglipron formulation. Compared to its weight loss medication endeavors, the company's large M&A moves and its encouraging pipeline may present more dependable growth paths. Overall PFE ranks 2nd on our list of the best GLP-1 and weight loss stocks to buy. You can visit 10 Best GLP-1 and Weight Loss Stocks to Buy Now to see the other GLP-1 and weight loss stocks that are on hedge funds’ radar. While we acknowledge the potential of PFE as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

      "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best GLP-1 and Weight Loss Stocks to Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Biohaven Pharmaceutical Holding Company Ltd. (NYSE:BHVN) stands against the other GLP-1 and weight loss stocks. According to WHO, more than one billion people worldwide are obese, including 650 million adults, 340 million adolescents, and 39 million children. A brand-new class of weight-loss drugs that don't require diets or intense exercise appears to be revolutionary. With the help of these revolutionary drugs, overweight and obese individuals can reduce their body weight by 15% to 20%. \"This could be the biggest opportunity that we've ever seen in the pharma industry,\" says Andy Acker, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson Investors. Without question, weight-loss drugs are popular. Investors are comparing the US weight-loss medicine pioneer, to the leader in artificial intelligence chips. Morgan Stanley Research, in light of this surge in demand, now projects that the global obesity drugs market will reach $105 billion in 2030, up from a previous estimate of $77 billion. In 2023, branded obesity drugs generated $6 billion in sales. In 2023, the obesity drug market leader Semaglutide (the generic name for Ozempic, Wegovy, and Rybelsus) was the most prescribed Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 GLP-1 agonist , accounting for more than 88% of all new prescriptions, as per Forbes. The only GLP-1 drugs for weight control that have FDA approval to date are tirzepatide, liraglutide, and semaglutide. J. P. Morgan Research estimates that the GLP-1 market will reach $100 billion by 2030, fueled equally by diabetes and obesity. By 2030, there may be 30 million GLP-1 users in the United States, or around 9% of the total population. The growing demand for obesity medications will have a wide-ranging impact, benefiting sectors such as biotech while generating headwinds for others, including food and beverage. Chris Schott, a Senior Analyst covering the U. S. Diversified Biopharma sector stated:“GLP-1s have been used to treat T2D since 2005, starting with the approval of Byetta, with follow-on products continually improving on efficacy. The most recent, Ozempic and Mounjaro, offer significant advantages over previous products and have accelerated class growth,” “Indeed, the newest generations of GLP-1s and combos lead to 15-25+% weight loss on average, well above prior generations of products. ”Regarding the treatment of obesity, some are hailing the newest generation of GLP-1 medications as \"miracle drugs. \" However, not everyone with obesity can use GLP-1s due to their high cost and restricted insurance coverage. According to Jonathan Gruber, Professor of Economics and Chairman of the Economics Department at MIT, if 40% of Americans with obesity took these treatments at present pricing (about $15,000 per person), the annual cost would exceed $1 trillion. This nearly equals the amount of money the government spends on the whole Medicare program. That's an astounding number, then. Over the past ten years, the usage of GLP-1 drugs, such as semaglutide, for weight loss has doubled, but among those with type 2 diabetes, its use has decreased by almost 10%, according to research published on Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine. The prolonged medication scarcity that followed, the researchers caution, may restrict the medications' accessibility to those with diabetes. Dr. Yee Hui Yeo, a clinical fellow in the Karsh Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology at Cedars-Sina, highlighted that as demand for obesity medications rises, it is critical to guarantee that diabetic patients have access to GLP-1 medicines. The FDA claims that the shortages are the result of rising demand. Not only do the shortages impact the United States: The European Medicines Agency cautioned that the GLP-1 drug shortage is a \"major public health concern\" that is unlikely to be remedied in 2024. People with diabetes have struggled to obtain their prescriptions due to shortages, with some limiting their drugs to manage, according to NPR. The experts on the panel \"Weighing the Future of Obesity Drugs,\" including Debra Netschert of Jennison Investments, Julia Angeles of Baillie Gifford, and Gentry Lee of Fayez Serofim, discussed the potential of GLP-1 drugs, which were initially developed for treating diabetes but are now being used to treat obesity. Netschert emphasized the progression of GLP-1 medication delivery, ranging from weekly dosages to several daily injections, as well as continuous attempts to reduce injection frequency further and minimize adverse reactions. Netschert pointed out that 1. 5 million out of the 110 million eligible patients in the United States are currently undergoing treatment with GLP-1 drugs, despite their outstanding performance, because of production limitations. Netschert and Angeles argued over who pays the expense, with Angeles claiming that the majority of patients pay out of pocket while Netschert cited considerable reimbursement from Medicare/Medicaid and insurance. Netschert stated that outside the borders of the United States, these drugs may be needed by as many as 700 million individuals worldwide. Notably, the panel discovered that U. K. payors, who are typically strict, authorized GLP-1 drugs faster than any other country, highlighting their perceived value. The obesity drugs market is a high-growth industry and since it's in its early innings, now may be a time to add some weight loss stocks to your watchlists.

(see more details here). A pharmacist in a white coat with a range of drugs on shelves behind her. Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 36The goal of Biohaven Pharmaceutical Holding Company Ltd. (NYSE:BHVN) is to create revolutionary life sciences products. Following Pfizer's acquisition of its parent firm in 2022, Biohaven Pharmaceutical Holding Company Ltd. (NYSE:BHVN) was founded and has given priority to several medication candidates undergoing various phases of clinical testing. Among its many pipeline products, Taldefgrobep Alfa (BHV-2000) is particularly noteworthy for its potential to treat obesity. Taldefgrobep Alfa is scheduled for Phase 2 studies for obesity in 2024 and is presently undergoing Phase 3 clinical trials for Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA). This medication, a myostatin inhibitor, works to prevent muscle loss disorders by preventing the myostatin protein, which normally prevents the development of muscle. Given that increasing muscle mass might help weight reduction and improve metabolism, the drug is a good choice for treating obesity. Taldefgrobep Alfa received a rare pediatric disease classification for SMA from the FDA, which might hasten the licensing process and signal a more favorable regulatory position. In order to ascertain the drug's safety and effectiveness for managing weight, the Phase 2 obesity study, which is set to begin in 2024, will be crucial. Biohaven Pharmaceutical Holding Company Ltd. (NYSE:BHVN) has roughly $283. 42 million in cash as of Q1 2024. Given the potential of Taldefgrobep Alfa, particularly in the event that Phase 2 findings are favorable, investor confidence and stock value may rise for BHVN. The stock is placed 8th on our list of the best GLP-1 and weight loss stocks to buy now. Analysts have given BHVN a “Strong Buy” rating. The average price target for Biohaven Pharmaceutical Holding Company Ltd. (NYSE:BHVN) is $54. 7, which presents a 41. 26% upside potential from the current price of $38. 73. According to Insider Monkey's Q1 2024 database, 36 hedge funds held a position in the company. In light of BHVN's relatively limited cash reserves and the possibility of future dilution, investors should exercise caution. Any unfavorable trial findings for Taldefgrobep Alfa can have a detrimental effect on the stock and raise the danger of dilution. Though there are challenges involved, you cannot overlook the company's drug's novel approach to treating obesity and the continued progress made in other treatment opportunities. Overall BHVN ranks 8th on our list of the best GLP-1 and weight loss stocks to buy.

      "Investors might not fully appreciate what Rivian (NASDAQ: RIVN) has already accomplished so far in its young history. Establishing an automaker from the ground up amid a complete industry transition from internal combustion engines to electric vehicles (EV) has been a tall task. Consider that 99 automakers starting with the letter \"A\" alone have gone bankrupt in past decades. The great news for long-term Rivian investors is that the company has a real chance to succeed, and the second quarter is showing just how much progress the company has made with its operations and cost reductions. Let's dig in!There have been quite a few technical improvements in company operations. One of the most overlooked improvements made over the summer came when Rivian updated its R1 vehicles to the second generation. While adding premium trims and new paint options could help spur demand, the big victory was efficiency gains and cost reductions. More specifically, the second generation R1 body was reengineered by eliminating 65 parts and reducing nearly 1,500 joints. In addition to the body improvements the company improved cycle time through the entire plant to increase vehicle production rate by 30%. Further, the second generation R1 includes the new in-house Ascent Tri drive unit which improves performance and lowers manufacturing cost by about 32%. The Enduro Dual Performance drive unit even further drops that cost, as you can see below. Another example found while digging through the details was the R1 front crossmember of its battery pack, which has been reduced by the use of high-pressure die casting that enables a 47% cost reduction. Rivian went from 17 electrical control units (ECUs) to seven, which removed 1. 6 miles of harness length and significantly lowered ECU cost. Those previously mentioned improvements, combined with commercial cost improvements and commodity tailwinds, are expected to create a 20% material cost reduction when comparing vehicles produced in the first quarter of 2024 to what will be produced in the fourth quarter of 2024—critical to the company generating positive gross margins this year. Ultimately, combining many of the cost reductions and efficiency improvements, Rivian improved cash used in operating activities by 41% compared to the first quarter of 2024. Developments like this are the difference between a company that will continue to attract investments, such as Volkswagen's commitment of up to $5 billion, and companies that shutter their doors, such as Fisker. Volkswagen's commitment and upcoming joint venture bring up a development that some investors overlook: the company's in-house software creation. Rivian develops the vast majority of its software, which was intentionally designed to be scalable and applicable across many varied hardware configurations. Essentially, Rivian's vertically integrated software platform could potentially be used by other automakers that invest in Rivian for joint ventures, such as Volkswagen, or perhaps in a licensing deal that could generate revenue for the company far down the road. The most important things for investors to watch going forward are the company's ability to reduce costs, keep deliveries churning at forecast levels, and to reach positive gross profit during the fourth quarter. Already Rivian has improved its loss per vehicle, which moved from a $38,700 per vehicle loss during the first quarter down to $32,700 per vehicle during the second quarter. Rivian's second quarter wasn't enough to convince the markets to push the stock higher, but keep in mind that Rivian shares spiked over 90% higher between May and the middle of July. If investors dig into the second quarter details, there was plenty to like with cost reductions, efficiency improvements, and its runway of cash that is expected to last into the production of R2 vehicles in 2026.

      "Rivian's (NASDAQ: RIVN) second quarter could go down as the most important in its history after the electric vehicle (EV) maker introduced its next-generation vehicle platform and struck a partnership with Volkswagen Group (OTC: VWAGY). However, those important events happened toward the end of the quarter and did not have a major impact on its Q2 results. Let's take a look at Rivian's most recent quarterly results and why the company appears to be ready to turn the corner. Rivian's Q2 revenue edged up 3% year over year to $1. 16 billion as the company delivered 13,790 vehicles in the quarter, a 9% increase from a year ago. It produced 9,612 vehicles in the quarter. Production fell both year over year and sequentially due to a planned shutdown at its manufacturing plant for a retooling upgrade. The company reiterated its guidance that it will produce 57,000 vehicles for the year. The biggest problem for Rivian has been that it's been selling its vehicles for much less than it costs to make them. This continued in the second quarter as it produced a negative gross profit of $451 million. That equates to a loss of $32,705 per vehicle just on the cost of making them and does not include any costs associated with selling the vehicles or any corporate or research and development costs. Rivian said that gross loss was negatively impacted by $59 million, or $4,278 per vehicle delivered, of costs that will not be in its long-term structure. Overall, Rivian reported an operating loss of $1. 38 billion. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), meanwhile, came in at negative $860 million. Not surprisingly given its negative gross margins, Rivian continued to burn cash. It had operating cash outflows of $754 million in the quarter. It spent another $283 million in capital expenditures (capex), bringing free cash flow to negative $1. 04 billion in the quarter. The company ended the quarter with $7. 87 billion in cash and short-term investments. It also was carrying $5. 53 billion in debt. While they didn't show up in its Q2 results, Rivian made a number of important moves during the quarter to improve both its gross margins and its balance sheet. Rivian took two major steps to improve gross margins. First it retooled its main manufacturing facility in Illinois. Management expects this upgrade to improve the manufacturing process, specifically cycle times, factory utilization, and costs. Second, it revamped the design of its second-generation vehicles to remove costs. This included moving to a zonal network architecture to greatly reduce the number of electronic control units in its vehicles, reducing vehicle complexity, and switching to some lower-cost materials. Rivian expects these changes to lead to a modest gross profit in Q4 and for the full year 2025 as it looks to lower material and conversion costs even further. Management expects positive gross profits in 2025 despite the company deciding to halt production for more than a month as it upgrades and integrates new equipment into its Illinois plant ahead of the launch of its R2 vehicles. In addition to these moves, the company also struck a deal to shore up its balance sheet through an investment and partnership with Volkswagen. The German automaker will make an initial investment of $1 billion into Rivian with up to $4 billion in planned additional investments once its joint venture (JV) is approved and certain financial and technological milestones are met. Rivian expects the JV to help it on the cost front, with Volkswagen's scale helping it get better pricing from suppliers. Rivian is heading in the right direction. Its new redesigned model lineup and upgraded manufacturing facility should lead to sustained positive gross margins. Meanwhile, it is now backed by some pretty big companies in Volkswagen and Amazon, which is its largest shareholder and for which it makes EV delivery vans. The company has the potential to be a big long-term EV winner, but it is still young. Any investment at this point is on the more speculative side.

Rivian Just Forecast This Important Metric Will Turn Positive. Is Now the Time to Buy the Stock? was originally published by The Motley Fool\n",
      "Rivian Automotive's (NASDAQ: RIVN) stock tumbled 7% on Aug. 7 after it posted a mixed second-quarter report. The electric vehicle (EV) maker's revenue rose 3% year over year to $1. 16 billion and exceeded analysts' expectations by $20 million. But its net loss widened from $1. 2 billion to $1. 46 billion, or $1. 46 per share, missing the consensus forecast by $0. 21. It slightly narrowed its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) loss from $861 million to $860 million. Those headline numbers weren't impressive, but Rivian had already warned investors of a slowdown this year as it focused on upgrading its plants instead of ramping up its deliveries. Rivian's stock could remain in the penalty box for at least a few more quarters, but is it worth accumulating right now at an 80% discount to its IPO price?Rivian sells the R1T pickup and R1S SUV for the mainstream EV market, and it also manufactures custom electric delivery vans for its top investor, Amazon. It plans to launch its cheaper R2 SUV in 2026, followed by its higher-end R3 and R3X SUVs in late 2026 to early 2027. The company will also continue to fulfill Amazon's long-term order for 100,000 vans through 2030, and it plans to sell those vans to other companies over the next few years. Rivian's deliveries produced 24,337 vehicles in 2022 and 57,232 vehicles in 2023. It ramped up its production as it overcame its supply chain constraints and installed its cheaper first-party Enduro drive unit into more of its vehicles. But in the first half of 2024, Rivian only produced 23,592 vehicles. For the full year, it expects its production to flatline at about 57,000 vehicles. That slowdown was mainly caused by a planned temporary shutdown of its plant in Normal, Illinois, in April to retool its production line and reduce its fixed costs per vehicle, as well as other macro and competitive headwinds. Rivian expects its production upgrades to drive it to a \"modest gross profit\" by the fourth quarter of 2024. It also aims to narrow its adjusted EBITDA loss from $3. 98 in 2023 to $2. 7 billion in 2024, even as its full-year capital expenditures rise 17% to $1. 2 billion. That was the same outlook it provided in its first-quarter report in May. Rivian is still a tiny underdog compared to Tesla, which produced 1. 85 million vehicles in 2023. But it's faring better than smaller EV makers like Lucid, which only produced 8,428 vehicles in 2023. The bulls believe Rivian can successfully scale up its business, but the bears believe it will burn through too much cash before that happens. However, its new partnership with Volkswagen should allay some of those concerns. In late June, Rivian partnered with the German automaker to co-develop new EV architecture and software through a new joint venture. Volkswagen will invest up to $5 billion in that partnership. This consists of $1 billion in Rivian's notes, which can be converted to its common shares on Dec. 1; two additional tranches of $1 billion investments in 2025 and 2026; a $1 billion initial investment in the JV; and an additional $1 billion loan to the JV in 2026. Rivian ended the second quarter of 2024 with $9. 18 billion in total liquidity, including $7. 87 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, so it should still have enough money to roll out its new R2 and R3 vehicles over the next three years. Its low debt-to-equity ratio of 0. 8 also gives it some breathing room to take on more leverage. Analysts expect Rivian's revenue to rise 7% to $4. 77 billion this year, as it delivers slightly more vehicles to offset its flat production rates. But from 2023 to 2026, they predict the automaker's revenue will grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 29% to $9. 61 billion as it ramps up its production and rolls out its new vehicles. With an enterprise value of $11. 26 billion, Rivian trades at just 2. 4 times this year's sales. In comparison, Tesla and Lucid trade at 5. 9 and 6. 9 times this year's sales, respectively. Therefore, Rivian looks undervalued relative to its growth potential -- and it could still be a great EV play for patient long-term investors.

      "After a big retooling of its Illinois assembly plant, Rivian’s (RIVN) updated “second generation” R1 vehicles are finally hitting showrooms. For a company with just two models — the R1T pickup and R1S SUV — these pricey products need to be nearly perfect to keep sales momentum going. Rivian began deliveries of the R1T pickup in October 2021, to almost immediate praise. The truck’s clean design, quad-motor power, off-road setup, and smooth vehicle dynamics made it a critic’s choice. So expectations were high when Rivian rolled out an SUV built on the same platform as the truck in August of 2022. But somehow, the magic was gone due to some ride and handling issues. The second-gen version out now gives Rivian a second chance to get it right. But the adventure EV maker operating in the near-luxury space, with prices starting around $80,000, seems to have whiffed again — with a somewhat bumpy ride to blame. Let's start with the positives. While the exterior of the updated Rivian R1 vehicles looks almost identical to the prior generation, the new vehicles have a lot going on under the skin. Rivian’s in-house-built dual-motor carries over — but Rivian is replacing the outsourced motors used in its quad-motor setup with new in-house motors that are more efficient and more powerful, the company said. A new high-performance tri-motor setup (with one motor up front, and two in the rear) is available for the R1S and R1T too. Rivian said it reengineered its Large and Max battery packs to reduce cost and weight, while delivering 330 miles and 420 miles of range, respectively, which is more range than similarly priced rivals. New heat pumps, “zonal” electrical architecture, and a reduced number of control modules and wiring further bring down costs and boost efficiency, Rivian said. But more importantly, Rivian said it was revising the suspension and handling setup of the R1S, which would result in “smoother ride quality. ” More on that later. The Rivian R1S, though boxy in appearance, does have soft edges in the right places, and that gives the car an upscale, modern look. It’s not surprising Rivian didn’t feel it had to update the vehicle’s design after a little over two years on the market, at least for the R1S. Inside the cabin, the level of appointments in terms of materials and fit and finish were on par with luxury brands like BMW (BMWYY) and Audi (VWAGY) though less cluttered. And the car’s NVH (noise, vibration, and harshness) characteristics were good. The cabin was quiet, there was no creaking or rattling, and there wasn’t much cheap plastic to bring down the quality of the interior. Rivian’s front seats were nicely padded, though more bolstering in the seat back and in the seat bottom would have made me happier. The R1S test vehicle provided to me by Rivian was a dual-motor performance version with a Max battery pack. This setup provided 665 horsepower, a 3. 4-second 0-60 mph time, and around 410 miles of range. That amount of horsepower is prodigious, but for a vehicle weighing around 7,000 lbs, it needs every horse it can get. While the acceleration was swift, it wasn’t as otherworldly as the quad-motor R1T that Yahoo Finance tested a couple of years back (nor would we expect it to be, given the quad-motor R1T's near 1,000 hp output). What was noticeable when accelerating? The significant weight transfer to the rear that pushes the front of the R1S up. While this happens in almost all vehicles under hard acceleration, it felt more pronounced in the R1S. That brings us to vehicle dynamics. We, which includes my colleague Rick Newman, could not compare the first-gen R1S to the second-gen vehicle we had on hand. That said, first impressions driving the R1S were uneven. At slower speeds the vehicle felt smooth and well damped, like a luxury vehicle should. But once rough road was encountered, the R1S became unsettled, and suspension rebound kept occupants bouncing for longer than was comfortable. The car felt floaty at times too, and the steering felt a tad less direct than we would have liked. Luke Lynch, Rivian’s director of vehicle dynamics, told Yahoo Finance that engineers focused on addressing some of the issues that affected the first-gen R1S. Lynch noted that the rear of the vehicle was heavier than the front, and that, coupled with a shorter wheelbase than the R1T, created an imbalance that needed to be addressed through adjustments to the suspension system and components. That's not an easy task, and addressing these imbalances seems to be a work in progress for Rivian. The good news: With cars and EVs these days being “software defined vehicles” as they are called, Rivian can address these issues with software updates that affect dampers, air suspensions setups, and the like. Lynch suggested we drive in the standard — or medium — ride height, as opposed to the lower setting, and set the suspension setting to “firm” as opposed to soft. (That can be accomplished under the car settings tab in the center console screen. ) This did help a lot with ride handling, though we did still experience a bit more “bounce” from bumps than we would have liked, But, to be fair, it was better. My guess is that, perhaps, the 22-inch wheels and the slimmer all-season performance tires didn’t help matters either. To be fair, European automakers have been making vehicles with sport or track suspension settings that are nearly undrivable. Nonetheless, going into a less aggressive setting typically gives users a more relaxed and composed ride. Still, for a vehicle costing around $90,000 (our test version), these issues need to, and we expect them to, be resolved. There's a lot on the line. Rivian has a lot of goodwill and a coolness factor still going for it (being an anti-Tesla helps). But legacy automakers are still pushing forward with luxury EV SUVs, and they are competing with the upstarts in terms of capability and price. Those include the Mercedes (MBGAF) EQE and EQS SUVs, BMW iX, Audi Q8 e-tron, and even the Kia (000270. KS) EV9 in the realm of competition. While the Rivian has the edge in a few areas, the differences are shrinking, and deficiencies like an uneven ride give the impression that the R1S isn’t the world-beater the Rivian faithful expect it to be. That all said, the R1S’s ride issues don't seem to matter at Rivian showrooms. Sales of the R1S are pulling ahead of the R1T, even though the pickup is cheaper. According to Kelley Blue Book, Rivian sold 16,154 R1S SUVs vs. 6,570 R1T trucks in the first half of 2024; a year ago, the figures stood at 6,745 and 10,638, respectively. The bottom line: While the Rivian experience is generally a positive one, the new R1S pales in comparison to its pickup truck brother from a vehicle dynamics perspective, making it a tougher sell in the competitive luxury EV SUV market.

      "In this piece, I evaluated two EV stocks, Tesla (TSLA) and Rivian Automotive (RIVN), using TipRanks’ Comparison Tool to see which is better. A closer look suggests a bullish view of Tesla and a neutral view of Rivian. Known for the Roadster, Model S, Model E, and now the Cybertruck, Tesla manufactures and sells all-electric vehicles, solar energy systems, and energy storage products. The company also operates a network of Supercharger stations. Meanwhile, Rivian is known for the R1S, an all-electric, mid-size SUV, and the mid-size, light-duty R1T pickup truck. Shares of Tesla have plunged 20% year-to-date and are down 18% in the past year. Rivian Automotive stock has plummeted 37% year-to-date and is down 34% in the past 12 months. Tesla’s and Rivian’s declines are indicative of the broader market for EV stocks, most of which have declined dramatically amid concerns about potentially weakening demand for EVs. Rivian is not profitable, so we’ll compare the companies’ price-to-sales (P/S) ratios to gauge their valuations against each other. We’ll also look at Tesla’s price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio for additional information. At a P/E of 54. 1x, Tesla is trading toward the lower end of its typical range, which has fluctuated between 39x and 83x since May 2022. The higher forward P/E of 68. 4x suggests analysts expect the company’s earnings to decline, in line with expectations of lower sales more broadly for EVs. However, a bullish view seems appropriate in light of the other factors explained below. At a P/S of 6. 8x, the profitable Tesla is trading at a significant premium to the unprofitable Rivian, which is absolutely warranted. On a P/S basis, Tesla is trading toward the bottom of its range (again, this range goes back to May 2022) of about 4. 8x to 13x. Importantly, Tesla isn’t just an EV stock. It also sells solar panel systems and energy storage, both areas where it gets little to no recognition. Tesla’s second-quarter earnings results showed a record 9. 4 GWh of energy-storage deployment during the quarter. Further, Energy Generation and Storage revenue doubled from $1. 5 billion a year ago to $3 billion in the latest quarter. While Automotive revenue dwarfed energy generation and storage, it did decline as expected, falling from $21. 3 billion a year ago to $19. 9 billion in the second quarter. However, the massive growth in Energy Generation and Storage is reason enough to be bullish on Tesla stock over the long term. This is especially true when paired with the Automotive business, which remains nicely profitable despite the recent price cuts and pricing war in China. In the second quarter, Tesla had a total GAAP gross margin of 18%, roughly flat with the year-ago margin of 18. 2% despite those price cuts. Tesla also recently won a massive multi-billion-dollar contract for energy storage in California. The company will provide more than 15 GWh of Megapack to Intersect Power, further igniting growth in the Energy Storage segment. Tesla has a Hold consensus rating based on 10 Buys, 14 Holds, and seven Sell ratings assigned over the last three months. At $211. 59, the average Tesla stock price target implies upside potential of 6. 4%. See more TSLA analyst ratingsAt a P/S of 2. 9x, Rivian’s valuation has been sliding steadily lower since normalizing at around 9. 5x in March 2023. However, the search for the next Tesla may not be over yet, as it seems too early to invest in Rivian shares. Thus, a neutral view seems appropriate — until more information gradually comes in. Rivian shares fell after the company missed earnings estimates for the second quarter, coming in at an adjusted loss of $1. 25 per share on $1. 2 billion in revenue versus expectations of $1. 24 per share in losses on $1. 17 billion in sales. Unfortunately, Rivian’s net losses grew during the recent quarter, rising to $1. 5 billion, or about $32,000 to $32,700 per vehicle. However, management said on the earnings call afterward that the loss was about $6,000 less per vehicle, showing that the company is making progress. In its letter to investors, Rivian management said it expects “a modest gross profit” in the fourth quarter. The company also reiterated its full-year guidance of producing 57,000 EVs, although that’s a slight decline from last year’s result of 57,232 vehicles. There’s no denying that this latest earnings report was mixed, so it may contain some causes for concern. For example, while the vehicle-production guidance may end up being conservative, just the fact that management is guiding for fewer vehicles than last year bears watching. The widening losses also bear monitoring. Additionally, while an outlook of a gross profit toward the end of the year is good news, Rivian is still miles away from GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) profitability. In late June, Rivian’s finance chief, Claire McDonough, said Rivian’s lower-cost, second-generation EVs will help push the firm toward profitability. She made the comments following a factory overhaul and vehicle redesign that aims to slash the cost of materials for those vehicles by 45%. While the company has launched those second-generation EVs, it’s just too early to say how successful they will be and whether those expectations will come to fruition. Over the long term, though, McDonough said the company expects a gross margin of 25% with an adjusted core profit margin in the high teens. As such, there’s no guarantee yet that Rivian’s vehicles will be able to stand up to Tesla’s. Tesla’s Cybertruck became the best-selling electric truck in the U. S. during the second quarter, beating Rivian’s R1T pickup. Rivian Automotive has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 12 Buys, eight Holds, and two Sell ratings assigned over the last three months. At $18, the average Rivian stock price target implies upside potential of 22. 3%. See more RIVN analyst ratingsWhile Rivian is making progress toward profitability, there’s no guarantee that it will be the next Tesla. However, the fact that it’s following a similar game plan of rolling out its more expensive vehicles first, followed by less expensive models designed to improve profitability, is promising. Nonetheless, Tesla remains the stalwart automaker in the EV space and, thus, a much safer investment, especially at current valuations. Rivian may receive a bullish view at some point, but it feels a bit too early to invest at its current valuation. I’d like to see lower multiples before becoming more constructive on the shares.

      "Former Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) executive Rohan Patel said on Wednesday that California Governor Gavin Newsom and his team have “bent over backwards” to help the EV giant despite CEO Elon Musk‘s criticisms. Don't Miss:Amid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity at just $500. This startup is on the brink of a huge disruption to the $654 billion industry – Here’s how to invest in it before it fulfills its 800 pre-orders in the next 2 weeks. Here’s the AI-powered startup that turns traders into influencers achieving 12% monthly growth – invest in it at only 10 cents per share. What Happened: “Newsom and his team bent over backwards to help Tesla. We didn't always agree with every action, but his top leadership always was willing to help whenever we asked,” Patel wrote, while also noting that the Governor owns a Tesla Roadster and a Model S. Patel was Tesla’s vice president of global public policy and business development until April earlier this year. See Also: Don’t miss out on the next Nvidia – you can invest in the future of AI for only $10. Patel further added that not all who find Musk’s political stances disturbing are against the company, its employees, or its products. “Even after the harshest tweets against Newsom or Biden or another Dem, their teams and governments did not shut me or my team out and were professional in working with us for the greater good,” he wrote. Newsom (Roadster and Model S owner with Tesla solar/powerwalls) and his team bent over backwards to help Tesla.

Patel was refuting Tesla enthusiast Omar Qazi, who goes by the username “Whole Mars Catalog. ” Qazi alleged that democrats hate Tesla after Newsom applauded EV startup Rivian for their rise in new registrations in the state of California during the second quarter and noted that Tesla is no longer the exclusive EV manufacturer for EVs in the state. Why It Matters: “I want to applaud and thank the extraordinary work that Rivian has done,” Newsom said on Tuesday. “Tesla is not the exclusive manufacturer any longer in this space. You're seeing a dramatic shift in competition across the sector. This is exactly what was predicted. This is exactly what we have been promoting: competition in the space. ”According to data from the California New Car Dealers Association released last month, California's BEV market share through the end of the second quarter stood 21. 4%, much higher than the U. S. BEV market share of 7. 5%. Trending: Want to invest in homes? $100 is enough on this platform that lets you cash out whenever you want.  As per the association, Tesla's new registrations fell 17% in the first half of 2024 while that of Rivian Automotive rose by nearly 77% in California. Tesla's mass-market Model Y SUV, however, continues to be the best-selling EV in the state, followed by the Model 3. Last month, Patel also said that the Biden administration treated EV giant fairly in certain issues despite \"surface-level disappointment\" between the President and Musk. \"No doubt Biden is very biased towards unions and appoints pro-Union people to the nlrb making it easier to organize. But it didn’t often create substantive problems, and instead was more of a PR and surface-level disappointment,\" Patel wrote on X while adding that it is just his personal view.

      "The latest earnings reports from Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ: RIVN) and Lucid Group Inc (NASDAQ: LCID) made two things clear. The first is that pure play EV makers are continuing to struggle, burning a ton of cash along the way. The second is that having wealthy backers makes the difference between survival and bankruptcy, the latter being the one that the wealthy-backer-free Fisker declared in June. Rivian is already seeing supply chain tailwinds from its planned $5 billion joint venture with Volkswagen (OTC: VWAGY) that was announced in June. The partnership gives Rivian the opportunity to scale beyond its product line and benefit from Volkswagen, more precisely its portfolio and strength.  Thanks to the Volkswagen relationship, Rivian is also expected to gain more favorable pricing from suppliers and therefore, thanks to Volkswagen, Rivian will be able to also save on hardware components. Rivian remains laser-focused on reducing the costs of making its R1 while it continues to source materials for the forthcoming R2, whose production is set to kick off in 2026. In what its CEO RJ Scaringe named a “pivotal operational event,” Rivian retooled its manufacturing plant in Normal, Illinois during the second quarter, which is said to have contributed to a 30% improvement on the R1 line rate, achieving gross cost per vehicle of $33,000, which is $10,000 down from 2023’s comparable quarter cost. During the company’s Q2 earnings call, Rivian reported a 41% improvement in its cash flow from operations compared to the first quarter, but still lost a staggering $1. 46 billion, which is $300 million worse compared to last year’s quarter. Although the securities filing shows that Rivian projects a net loss of $2. 7 billion in 2024, Rivian is also targeting to reach its first-ever positive gross margin before 2024 comes to a close. Also for the second quarter, Lucid Group reported a net loss of $643 million which is a slight improvement compared to 2023’s quarter when the luxury EV maker reported a loss of $764 million. But, thanks to its majority shareholder bringing in an additional $1. 5 billion, Lucid secured the extension of its lifespan. Without ICE or hybrid vehicles to fall back on, Rivian and Lucid are feeling the EV cooldown way more than legacy automakers like Toyota Motor (NYSE: TM), General Motors (NYSE: GM), Ford Motor (NYSE: F) and others.  But, even the mighty Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) is racing to refresh its ageing lineup with an affordable EV. Rivian is doing the same with the R2 and Lucid is going the same with the Gravity SUV. With these novelties, Lucid, Rivian as well as Tesla hope to attract new customers. Even the mighty Tesla needs to spark some fresh EV enthusiasm. Meanwhile, innovations on the EV front keep on coming. Worksport Ltd. (NASDAQ: WKSP), a U. S. -based manufacturer and innovator of hybrid and clean energy solutions for light trucks will expand its market presence this summer with an innovative power duo COR & SOLIS, or more precisely, their alpha release. With a solar-powered tonneau cover SOLIS and a portable battery system COR, Worksport promises to do much more than enhance the range of electric pickups, as it brings off-grid power on the go, opening many new opportunities with General Motors, Ford Motor and Stellantis pickups, even Tesla, whose long-awaited Cybertruck came with many challenges. To enhance investor engagement and transparency, Worksport announced a Q&A portal ahead of its upcoming Q2 2024 earnings call. Scheduled for August 13th, 2024, at 4:30 p. m, Woksport management will use the call to provide a detailed overview of the second quarter financial results and guidance, along with the sales trajectory, key product launches, and future plans.

      "In 2021, Apple changed its privacy rules, which made it harder for application developers to track their users across the internet. That meant social media companies like Snap (NYSE: SNAP) couldn't target users as effectively to sell advertising slots to businesses. Snap has grappled with that challenge ever since, but it's helping advertisers achieve their goals in other ways. The company created an algorithm called 7/0 Optimization that features a seven-day learning period at a flat rate, with no extra charges if an ad outperforms expectations during that period. Plus, Snap is a leader in augmented reality, which is a unique and engaging way to showcase products to potential customers. But here's Snap's biggest advantage: SnapChat continues to attract new users, which means it will remain a desirable destination for advertisers. The platform had a record 432 million daily active users during the second quarter of 2024 (ended June 30), and that number has climbed consistently:Moreover, Snap says it serves 75% of 13-to-34-year-olds in 25 different countries -- so its users are young, which is an attractive feature for advertisers. Besides innovating on the advertising side, Snap also offers a subscription that gives users a range of benefits, including early access to new features. It's priced at $3. 99 per month, and it has over 11 million members so far. While the Russell 2000 index of small-cap stocks has fallen more than 9% since the end of July, Snap has fared even worse, down more than one-third in the same period. At recent prices, it trades at a price to sales (P/S) ratio of just 2. 8, which is near its cheapest level since the company came public in 2017. In my opinion, that doesn't make much sense given the positive trends in its business. That might spell an opportunity for investors.

      "Shares of Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) and Snap (NYSE: SNAP) went in opposite directions after their latest earnings reports. Meta's stock rose 5% on Aug. 1 after its second-quarter report easily cleared analysts' estimates on the top and bottom lines. Snap's stock plunged 16% on the same day as its fourth-quarter revenue landed below analysts' expectations and its adjusted earnings merely matched the consensus forecast. Over the past three years, Meta's stock has risen nearly 40% as Snap's stock plunged more than 80%. So will the social media leader continue to crush the struggling underdog?Meta is the world's largest social media company. It ended the second quarter of 2024 with 3. 27 billion daily active people (DAP) across its \"family\" of apps (Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp), up 7% from a year earlier. Snap carved out a niche among younger users with its ephemeral messages and augmented reality filters. Its total number of daily active users (DAUs) grew 9% year over year to 432 million in the second quarter of 2024. Over the past year, Meta's DAP growth has remained remarkably stable -- but Snap's DAU growth decelerated and dropped to the single digits in its latest quarter. At this rate, Snap could eventually grow its daily audience at a slower rate than Meta. MetricQ2 2023Q3 2023Q4 2023Q1 2024Q2 2024Meta Platforms DAP growth (YOY)7%7%8%7%7%Snap DAU growth (YOY)14%12%10%10%9%Data source: Quarterly earnings reports. YOY = year over year. Meta and Snap both generate most of their revenue from ads. But over the past year, Meta grew its revenue at a much faster rate than Snap even though it was gaining daily active users across its apps at a slower clip than Snapchat. MetricQ2 2023Q3 2023Q4 2023Q1 2024Q2 2024Meta Platforms revenue growth (YOY)11%23%25%27%22%Snap revenue growth (YOY)(4%)5%5%21%16%Data source: Quarterly earnings reports. For the third quarter, Meta expects its revenue to rise 13% to 20% year over year while Snap anticipates 12% to 16% growth. It's usually a red flag when the underdog is growing at a slower rate than the market leader. Meta has been growing faster than Snap because Meta is attracting more spending from Chinese e-commerce and gaming companies (which are targeting overseas consumers), simultaneously growing its ad prices and ad impressions, expanding its Reels short video platform to counter TikTok, and gathering more first-party data with its AI-powered algorithms to counter Apple's disruptive privacy changes on iOS. Snap didn't attract the same interest from Chinese advertisers, its Spotlight video platform didn't gain much traction against Reels and TikTok, and its ad prices fell even as its total number of ad impressions increased. Snap is also relying too heavily on its overseas users -- who generate a fraction of the ad revenues of its North American users -- to drive its DAU growth. Meta is consistently profitable on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis, even though it's subsidizing the expansion of its unprofitable Reality Labs division (which produces its VR and AR devices) with its higher-margin ad revenues. Snap is still unprofitable on a GAAP basis, and it's expected to stay in the red for the foreseeable future. MetricQ2 2023Q3 2023Q4 2023Q1 2024Q2 2024Meta Platforms operating margin29%40%41%38%38%Snap operating margin(38%)(32%)(18%)(28%)(21%)Data source: Quarterly earnings reports. GAAP basis. For the full year, analysts expect Meta's operating margin to expand 4 percentage points to 39%, and for Snap's operating margin to improve about 12 percentage points to negative 18%. That would represent a step in the right direction for Snap, but the company is still plowing a lot of cash into buybacks to offset the dilution from its stock-based compensation. That's not a good look for an unprofitable company with negative cash flows. Over the past five years, Snap's number of outstanding shares actually increased by 18%. Meta, which launched a $50 billion buyback plan earlier this year, reduced its number of outstanding shares by 11% during the same period. Meta trades at 25 times forward earnings, which makes it the second-cheapest \"Magnificent Seven\" stock after Alphabet. Snap can't be valued by its GAAP earnings, but it trades at 58 times forward non-GAAP earnings -- which exclude the stock-based compensation and other one-time expenses. The choice between Meta and Snap is a simple one. Would you rather invest in the world's largest social media company, which is still growing even though it already serves about 40% of the world's population, or the niche underdog that is trying to keep pace with its nimbler competitors as it torches tens of millions of dollars each quarter? Meta's stock is also cheaper relative to its growth potential -- so it should easily stay ahead of Snap for the foreseeable future.

      "Shares of social network Snapchat (NYSE: SNAP) fell 9. 2% in the pre-market session after markets continued to decline, although they have recovered a bit since the open (Nasdaq down 3. 6%, S&P 500 down 3%). Yields also retreated as worries about a US recession grew. The declines followed volatility on Friday, August 2, when the July Non-Farm Payrolls data revealed weaker job growth as the unemployment rate rose. Markets might also be concerned that the Fed is behind in cutting rates, with the Federal Open Market Committee leaving rates steady at 5. 25%-5. 50% during the July 2024 meeting. For example, respected economist and University of Pennsylvania professor Jeremy Siegel took an aggressive stance, calling on the Fed to make an emergency 75 basis-point cut in the federal funds rate after Friday’s disappointing jobs report. As a reminder, the driver of a stock's value is the sum of its future cash flows discounted back to today. With lower interest rates, investors can apply higher valuations to their stocks. However, the economy matters as well. Recessions can mean broad-based declines in demand for everything from consumer goods to enterprise software. We at StockStory remain cautious, as following the crowd can lead to adverse outcomes. During times like this, it's best to own high-quality, cash-flowing companies that can weather the ups and downs of the market. The stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Snap? Access our full analysis report here, it's free. Snap's shares are very volatile and over the last year have had 16 moves greater than 5%. In context of that, today's move is indicating the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business. The previous big move we wrote about was 3 days ago, when the stock dropped 24. 7% on the news that the company reported second-quarter earnings results. Its revenue unfortunately missed analysts' expectations, and its revenue guidance for the next quarter came in slightly below Wall Street's estimates. Adding to the negativity was the fact that adjusted EBITDA guidance for the next quarter was significantly below. Overall, this quarter could have been better. Snap is down 44. 9% since the beginning of the year, and at $8. 86 per share it is trading 49. 3% below its 52-week high of $17. 45 from February 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Snap's shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $540. Today’s young investors likely haven’t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy.

      "Even with the stock market’s impressive gains, there’s no shortage of undervalued stocks if you know where to look. The recent correction has just scratched the surface of the tech sector. Those high-flyers have further to fall before being considered undervalued. However, if you’re willing to dig deeper, you’ll find plenty of overlooked names that have languished at undervalued levels for months or even years. I think it’s worth scooping up some of these hidden gems before the economic tide turns. Many of these companies have the resilience and cash flow potential to outperform once interest rates are cut and their financials outpace their stock prices. Granted, it might take longer than a year for the stars to align perfectly for these undervalued plays. But I’m convinced they can beat the broader market over the next couple of years as they recover. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSource: Ian_Stewart / ShutterstockNorwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH) operates a fleet of cruise ships that sail to destinations around the world. The company has been navigating choppy waters lately, as it had to take on significant debt during the pandemic to stay afloat and was then hit with spiking interest rates that crushed profitability and forced cutbacks in growth investments like marketing spend. Despite these challenges, I believe Norwegian Cruise Line stock is undervalued and poised for a major rebound in the next 12 months. The company just reported strong Q2 2024 results, with revenue up 8% to $2. 4 billion and adjusted earnings per share of 40 cents, beating estimates by 23%. Both its segments have recovered in terms of revenue, and profitability should follow suit once debt servicing costs decline.

The consensus rating is still a “Hold,” but I think that will change as interest rates come down and profitability improves. Norwegian’s debt load has doubled since 2019 to $13. 7 billion, but even a small interest rate cut would provide a big boost to the bottom line. With the stock still 69% below pre-pandemic levels, I see huge upside potential as the cruise industry recovers. If you’re willing to ride out some near-term volatility, Norwegian Cruise Line looks like a very attractive risk reward at these depressed levels. The company is steadily improving operationally, and I expect the stock to start sailing much higher in the coming quarters. Source: T.

The company has been navigating a challenging environment, with its stock price trading sideways for the past two and a half years following an initial crash from the post-COVID boom in 2021. However, I believe StoneCo is well-positioned to capture a significant share of Brazil’s rapidly growing fintech market, in which it already holds 11. 3%. Brazil has been ahead of the curve in its inflation and rate cut cycle, having started raising rates earlier and subsequently cutting them substantially as inflation subsided. In my opinion, StoneCo stands to benefit greatly from this trend in the long run, even though STNE stock has yet to reflect the company’s improving fundamentals. According to recent analyst estimates, StoneCo’s EPS is projected to grow from $1. 20 in 2024 to $2. 60 by 2027. Revenue and operating profits are both expected to recover and keep growing, and I think the stock should, too.

The company has been facing challenges recently, with its stock price still down 72% from its 2021 peak following rising interest rates. TLPFY used to be one of the most consistent stocks, often outperforming the broader market. However, higher rates have hit the company hard. I believe a turnaround may be underway, though, as global rates start to ease. With Teleperformance’s solid fundamentals, this could be an exceptional long-term buying opportunity, sweetened by a 3. 24% dividend yield. In H1 2024, Teleperformance reported accelerating growth and increased free cash flow (“H1 2024 revenue: €5,076 million, up +28. 2% as reported and +1. 7% pro forma | Q2 2024 revenue: €2,534 million, up +29. 7% as reported and +2. 4% pro forma”). The company is also seeing the first effects of cost synergies from its Majorel acquisition. Some see Teleperformance as well-positioned with a resilient, diversified client base. Others are more cautious, given the uncertain macro environment. Regardless, I believe Teleperformance can weather this storm and is quite undervalued.

The company has faced challenges recently, with high interest rates causing banks and merchants to be more cautious and transaction volumes slowing down. SQ stock has been stuck in a rut along with many other fintech stocks, as the post-pandemic rush of users has subsided and account growth figures seem stagnant. However, I believe most fintech stocks, including Block, are poised for a comeback as interest rates start to decline and we enter a new economic cycle. Block’s core financials have been impressive, with the company reporting $6. 16 billion in revenue and EPS of 93 cents in Q2 2024, beating analysts’ estimates on the bottom line. The company has turned into a profitable growth stock and should be trading at a much higher valuation. That said, Block is not without its challenges. The company is currently under federal investigation for potential breaches in know-your-customer and anti-money laundering rules. Nevertheless, the majority of Wall Street analysts maintain a “Moderate Buy” rating on SQ stock, with an average price target of $88. 9, representing a 48. 4% upside. If Wall Street paid even half the pre-COVID earnings premium, the stock would trade at $150 today.

While it may take longer than 12 months for the stock to surge 500%, I think patient investors will be rewarded in the long run. Source: BigTunaOnline / ShutterstockSnap (NASDAQ:SNAP) stock has been one of the weakest social media stocks over the past few years, and it has continued to disappoint investors like myself. Despite my frustrations, I still believe Snap could be a good long-term holding if they can turn things around. After Snap’s weak Q2 guidance, the stock has slumped to around $10, which looks cheap considering the company is still delivering double-digit revenue growth. However, Snap urgently needs to improve its average revenue per user to stage a comeback like Meta (NASDAQ:META) did. It missed in the near term, but the long-term looks very promising. I can make the same argument about SNAP like I did with SQ. Growth hasn’t slowed by that much and it can still trade near pre-COVID multiples if management doesn’t make a fool of themselves going forward. Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus. comThe recent earnings show it will take longer than hoped, but potential catalysts like a TikTok ban in the U. S. could reignite interest in Snapchat. If Snap can find ways to better monetize its large, young user base, the stock has huge upside potential. But until they prove they can execute, you should still stay cautious. Source: shutterstock. com/Sergei ElaginMethode Electronics (NYSE:MEI) has also been a big loser in the stock market for the past year and a half. It has lost nearly 77% of its value since the start of 2023, but I think it can turn things around once rates come down and the automotive industry makes a comeback. Analysts seem mixed about the stock. Jefferies recently initiated MEI with “Hold. ” The decline has pulled the stock back down to more historical lows, and if things get better, it could rally back up like it did in 2012. Recent news has been mixed. Methode reported a net loss in Q4 2024 on lower sales, but it did generate positive free cash flow and reduced its net debt. The company also won over $140 million in new program awards in the quarter, mainly in EV applications. If you’re willing to bet on an automotive rebound, MEI could be an undervalued opportunity. Analysts expect profits and positive sales growth next year.

The company has hit some turbulence lately, with its stock losing nearly 80% of its value over the past year amid integration challenges with its acquisition of Omni Logistics and a sluggish demand environment. It wasn’t always this rough for Forward Air, though. The company used to be one of the most consistent and stable performers in the transportation sector until the ripple effects of the pandemic sent shares plummeting. While the stock has bounced off the bottom a bit, it’s still struggling, down another 6% recently with the broader market selloff. However, I believe Forward Air could be a solid long-term bet for patient investors willing to ride out the current storm. Activist investor Irenic Capital Management seems to agree, recently amassing a 5% stake and pushing the company to improve performance or consider a sale. The Wall Street Journal reported that Irenic believes several private equity firms would be interested in acquiring Forward Air at a substantial premium.

      "Have you evaluated the performance of Snap's (SNAP) international operations for the quarter ending June 2024? Given the extensive global presence of this company behind Snapchat, analyzing the patterns in international revenues is crucial for understanding its financial strength and potential for growth. In the modern, closely-knit global economic landscape, the capacity of a business to access foreign markets is often a key determinant of its financial well-being and growth path. Investors now place great importance on grasping the extent of a company's dependence on international markets, as it sheds light on the firm's earnings stability, its skill in leveraging various economic cycles and its broad growth potential. Being present in foreign markets serves as protection against local economic declines and helps benefit from more rapidly expanding economies. Yet, such expansion also introduces challenges related to currency fluctuations, geopolitical uncertainties and varied market behaviors. While delving into SNAP's performance for the past quarter, we observed some fascinating trends in the revenue from its foreign segments that are commonly modeled and observed by analysts on Wall Street. The company's total revenue for the quarter amounted to $1. 24 billion, showing rise of 15. 8%. We will now explore the breakdown of SNAP's overseas revenue to assess the impact of its international operations. Of the total revenue, $229. 84 million came from Rest of World during the last fiscal quarter, accounting for 18. 6%. This represented a surprise of -10. 94% as analysts had expected the region to contribute $258. 07 million to the total revenue. In comparison, the region contributed $255. 8 million, or 21. 4%, and $198. 73 million, or 18. 6%, to total revenue in the previous and year-ago quarters, respectively. During the quarter, Europe contributed $239. 37 million in revenue, making up 19. 4% of the total revenue. When compared to the consensus estimate of $213. 29 million, this meant a surprise of +12. 23%. Looking back, Europe contributed $195. 84 million, or 16. 4%, in the previous quarter, and $182. 11 million, or 17. 1%, in the same quarter of the previous year. It is projected by analysts on Wall Street that Snap will post revenues of $1. 35 billion for the ongoing fiscal quarter, an increase of 14% from the year-ago quarter. The expected contributions from Rest of World and Europe to this revenue are 19. 2% and 17. 1%, translating into $260. 61 million and $231. 35 million, respectively. For the full year, a total revenue of $5. 36 billion is expected for the company, reflecting an increase of 16. 3% from the year before. The revenues from Rest of World and Europe are expected to make up 20% and 17. 2% of this total, corresponding to $1. 07 billion and $919. 14 million respectively. Relying on global markets for revenues presents both prospects and challenges for Snap. Therefore, scrutinizing its international revenue trends is key to effectively forecasting the company's future outlook. In an era of growing international ties and escalating geopolitical disputes, financial analysts on Wall Street pay keen attention to these developments to fine-tune their earnings estimations for businesses operating across borders. It's important to note, however, that a range of additional variables, like a company's local market status, also play a crucial role in shaping these forecasts. At Zacks, a company's changing earnings outlook is given considerable attention due to its proven, strong influence on a stock's price performance in the near term. The connection here is straightforward and positive: when earnings estimates are revised upward, the stock price generally follows suit, increasing as well. The Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating mechanism, demonstrates a notable performance history confirmed through external audits. It effectively utilizes the power of earnings estimate revisions to act as a predictor of a stock's price performance in the near term. At the moment, Snap has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), signifying that its performance may align with the overall market trend in the upcoming period. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>The stock has witnessed a decline of 42. 9% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's a decrease of 2. 9%.

Over the past three months, the company's shares saw a decrease of 41. 5%, while the S&P 500 increased by 5. 9%. In comparison, the sector experienced an increase of 6. 3% during this timeframe.

      "One of the biggest stories of last week was how Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP) shares plunged 30% in the week since its latest quarterly results, closing yesterday at US$9. 36. The results look positive overall; while revenues of US$1. 2b were in line with analyst predictions, statutory losses were 4. 9% smaller than expected, with Snap losing US$0. 15 per share. This is an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance in its report, look at what experts are forecasting for next year, and see if there has been any change to expectations for the business. We thought readers would find it interesting to see the analysts latest (statutory) post-earnings forecasts for next year. View our latest analysis for Snap Taking into account the latest results, the current consensus from Snap's 37 analysts is for revenues of US$5. 36b in 2024. This would reflect a satisfactory 7. 7% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months. Losses are predicted to fall substantially, shrinking 26% to US$0. 53. Before this latest report, the consensus had been expecting revenues of US$5. 38b and US$0. 51 per share in losses. So it's pretty clear consensus is mixed on Snap after the new consensus numbers; while the analysts held their revenue numbers steady, they also administered a pronounced increase to per-share loss expectations. With the increase in forecast losses for next year, it's perhaps no surprise to see that the average price target dipped 5. 7% to US$14. 55, with the analysts signalling that growing losses would be a definite concern. The consensus price target is just an average of individual analyst targets, so - it could be handy to see how wide the range of underlying estimates is. The most optimistic Snap analyst has a price target of US$20. 00 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at US$10. 00. Note the wide gap in analyst price targets? This implies to us that there is a fairly broad range of possible scenarios for the underlying business. Of course, another way to look at these forecasts is to place them into context against the industry itself. It's pretty clear that there is an expectation that Snap's revenue growth will slow down substantially, with revenues to the end of 2024 expected to display 16% growth on an annualised basis. This is compared to a historical growth rate of 23% over the past five years. Juxtapose this against the other companies in the industry with analyst coverage, which are forecast to grow their revenues (in aggregate) 10% per year. So it's pretty clear that, while Snap's revenue growth is expected to slow, it's still expected to grow faster than the industry itself. The most important thing to note is the forecast of increased losses next year, suggesting all may not be well at Snap. Fortunately, they also reconfirmed their revenue numbers, suggesting that it's tracking in line with expectations. Additionally, our data suggests that revenue is expected to grow faster than the wider industry. The consensus price target fell measurably, with the analysts seemingly not reassured by the latest results, leading to a lower estimate of Snap's future valuation. Keeping that in mind, we still think that the longer term trajectory of the business is much more important for investors to consider.

      "Strengths highlight Snap Inc's robust user engagement and innovative advertising solutions. Weaknesses underscore the challenges in cost management and net loss concerns. Opportunities emphasize potential market expansion and product diversification. Threats reveal the competitive landscape and external economic pressures. On August 2, 2024, Snap Inc (NYSE:SNAP) filed its 10-Q report, providing a detailed look into its financial performance and strategic positioning. As a social networking powerhouse with over 400 million daily active users, Snap Inc is a significant player in the digital advertising space. Despite a strong user base, the company's financials show a net loss of $248. 62 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared to a net loss of $377. 308 million for the same period in 2023. Revenue growth is evident, with a reported $1. 236 billion in the second quarter of 2024, up from $1. 067 billion in 2023. However, operating losses and increased costs in key areas such as research and development, sales, and marketing indicate areas of concern. This SWOT analysis will delve into the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats as identified in the recent SEC filing, providing a comprehensive overview for investors and stakeholders. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with SNAP. User Engagement and Brand Loyalty: Snap Inc's primary strength lies in its high user engagement and brand loyalty, particularly among younger demographics. The company's focus on innovative features and user experience has fostered a dedicated user base that spends significant time on the platform. This engagement is a critical asset for attracting advertisers looking to reach this coveted audience segment. Innovative Advertising Solutions: Snap Inc has developed a suite of advertising products that leverage augmented reality (AR) and other immersive technologies. These offerings differentiate the company from competitors and provide unique value to advertisers seeking to engage users in novel ways. Financial Resilience: Despite reporting a net loss, Snap Inc has shown resilience in its revenue growth. The increase in revenue, particularly from the North American market, which accounts for a significant portion of sales, indicates a strong market presence and the potential for future profitability. Cost Management: The 10-Q filing reveals that Snap Inc's costs and expenses have risen, with research and development, sales, and marketing seeing notable increases. This trend raises concerns about the company's cost management strategies and its impact on the bottom line. Net Loss Concerns: The persistent net losses reported by Snap Inc are a glaring weakness. While the loss has decreased year-over-year, the company's inability to achieve profitability remains a significant concern for investors and could impact long-term sustainability. Dependence on Advertising Revenue: Snap Inc's reliance on advertising revenue makes it vulnerable to market fluctuations and changes in advertiser spending. Diversifying revenue streams could mitigate this risk, but the company has yet to establish significant alternative sources of income. Market Expansion: Snap Inc has the opportunity to expand its user base internationally, particularly in regions where smartphone penetration is growing. Tailoring products and marketing strategies to local tastes and preferences could unlock new revenue streams. Product Diversification: Developing new products and services beyond advertising, such as premium subscriptions or e-commerce integrations, could provide Snap Inc with additional revenue sources and reduce its dependence on advertising. Strategic Partnerships: Forming strategic partnerships with content creators, technology providers, and other businesses could enhance Snap Inc's offerings and create new avenues for growth. Competitive Landscape: Snap Inc operates in a highly competitive industry, with rivals like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok vying for user attention and advertising dollars. The company must continuously innovate to maintain its market position. Economic Pressures: External economic factors, such as recessions or shifts in advertising spending, could adversely affect Snap Inc's revenue. The company must navigate these challenges while striving to achieve profitability. Regulatory Changes: Changes in privacy and data protection laws could impact Snap Inc's ability to collect and utilize user data for advertising purposes, potentially hindering its core business model. In conclusion, Snap Inc's latest SEC filing paints a picture of a company with a strong user base and innovative advertising products but facing significant challenges in achieving profitability and managing costs. The company's strengths in user engagement and brand loyalty are offset by weaknesses in net loss concerns and reliance on advertising revenue. Opportunities for market expansion and product diversification present potential paths for growth, while threats from the competitive landscape and economic pressures loom large. Investors and stakeholders should weigh these factors carefully when considering Snap Inc's strategic position and future prospects.

      "Once on opposite sides, Elon Musk and Donald Trump are now working together as the 2024 presidential election draws near. According to CNBC, while perhaps expected by many, their partnership is still raising important questions about what's driving these two powerful figures to join forces and how it could impact the future of the electric vehicle (EV) industry and beyond. Don't Miss:Amid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity at just $500. This startup is on the brink of a huge disruption to the $654 billion industry – Here’s how to invest in it before it fulfills its 800 pre-orders in the next 2 weeks. Musk, the CEO of Tesla, and Trump, the former president, have a history of disagreements, especially on issues like climate change and electric vehicles. Trump has been very critical of EVs and has many times downplayed the importance of addressing climate change. On the other hand, Musk has built his career on promoting clean energy and sustainability, although his excessive private jet use and penchant for launching rockets into space paint a different picture. Even with these differences, Musk recently decided to back Trump for the 2024 election, showing that their relationship is changing. This decision has led people to wonder what benefits they might gain from working together and how it could impact politics and the economy. Trending: This new startup venture is the future of automated convenience stores — read more about why these $10 pre-IPO shares are so valuable before the offer closes in just 10 days. As the head of companies like Tesla, SpaceX, and X (formerly Twitter), Musk has a lot of business interests that could do well with the right president in office. For example, if Trump becomes president again, SpaceX might get more government contracts, especially since it competes with big defense companies like Boeing. Plus, Tesla could benefit if Trump tariffs Chinese goods since China is one of Tesla's main competitors in the U. S. market. There has been some confusion about how much money Musk contributes to Trump's campaign. \"I love Elon Musk . . . we have to make life good for us smart people. And he's as smart as you get,\" Trump said. \"He gives me $45 million a month! C'mon. Not $45 million. He gives me $45 million a month. \"See Also: Here’s the AI-powered startup that turns traders into influencers achieving 12% monthly growth – invest in it at only 10 cents per share. So, Trump claimed that Musk was donating $45 million a month, but Musk quickly denied this, clarifying that his donations are much smaller and are funneled through a political action committee (PAC). \"I'm not donating $45 million a month to Trump,\" Musk told podcaster Jordan Peterson. Regardless of the exact financial contributions, Musk is leveraging his influence on social media to promote Trump and their shared political views, including opposition to progressive issues like critical race theory and transgender rights, which resonate with Trump's base. Musk and Trump working together raises questions about the future of the electric vehicle industry, especially since Trump has usually been skeptical of EVs and prefers traditional fossil fuels. In his words, “They don’t go far. They cost a fortune,” “We’re going to end your mandate on [electric] cars,” and “These people are crazy. They want to make all-electric trucks, the big 18-wheelers,” among other things. However, with Musk's backing, there's a possibility that Trump might adopt a more favorable stance on electric cars. In fact, we already see his tune changing: \"I love Elon. He's great,\" he said. He endorsed me and gave me great endorsements and everything else, but not everybody has to have an electric car. \"Trending: With returns as high as 300%, it’s no wonder this asset is the investment choice of many billionaires. Uncover the secret. We can now see him tell his audience, \"I'm for electric cars. \" \"I have to be, you know because Elon strongly endorsed me. So, I have no choice. \"On the flip side, if Trump's policies were to slow down the progress of EVs and clean energy, Musk's support for him could potentially harm the advancements Musk has worked so hard to achieve. As Musk and Trump join their efforts, the potential effects on the EV industry and broader technology sectors remain uncertain.

      "Tesla stopped taking orders for the cheapest model of its Cybertruck electric pickup, which was priced at $61,000. Now, its $100,000 version is the cheapest model available for order on the automaker's website. Consumers and investors have closely monitored the supply and demand of Tesla's Cybertruck after CEO Elon Musk invested heavily in the EV truck line in recent years with the goal of producing 200,000 annually. Musk said last fall that Tesla had 1 million reservations for the truck. Some customers have indicated they're waiting for less expensive versions to be available because its prices have been higher and driving ranges lower than originally forecast. The unconventional, futuristic Cybertruck was first unveiled as a prototype by Musk in 2019, when he estimated it would cost $40,000 and be able to travel 500 miles on a single charge. Interested buyers were able to place a reservation with a refundable $100 deposit to secure their truck once deliveries began after lengthy delays that pushed it back until late November 2023. TESLA'S CYBERTRUCK MAKING INROADS ON THE ROADTesla's website no longer offers would-be buyers the ability to reserve a $61,000 version of the Cybertruck, which had been offered with a 250-mile range and a targeted delivery of 2025. READ ON THE FOX BUSINESS APPIt currently offers a $99,990 dual-motor variant Foundation limited series model that has a 318-mile range and is estimated to be delivered as early as this month. The $119,990 tri-motor Foundation Cyberbeast variant, with a range of 301 miles, will be available starting in October. CYBERTRUCK'S PRICE TAG DRAWS MIXED REVIEWSGuidehouse Insights analyst Sam Abuelsamid told Reuters that Tesla's move \"shows that demand is a lot less than a million trucks\" and added, \"They're sitting on a lot of inventory of two-motor and three-motor trucks right now. \"Deliveries of the Cybertruck, which features a trapezoidal exterior design that was inspired by the movie \"Bladerunner,\" as well as a stainless steel body, began in November 2023 after years of delay and a difficult production ramp-up. TESLA'S QUARTERLY RESULTS MISS ESTIMATES AFTER PRICE CUTS HIT BOTTOM LINEThe first production candidate Cybertruck was completed in July 2023, roughly four years after Musk announced Tesla's plans to make the truck and two years after production was initially planned to begin. Musk said in 2022 that supply chain shortages affected the sourcing of components and contributed to the production delay. Reuters contributed to this report.

      "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:The chart of the dayWhat we're watchingWhat we're readingEconomic data releases and earningsAnd just like that, everyone is a recession expert. Two weeks ago, most self-proclaimed finance experts hadn't uttered the word recession since it was fashionable in late 2022/early 2023. From late July to early August, the prevailing sentiment of those seemingly in the know was 1) Nvidia (NVDA) shares were due for another 50% move after earnings on Aug. 28; 2) a 10% year-end rally for the S&P 500; and 3) a 100% move in Nvidia's stock price in 2025. Yet here we are, with the pros scaring the heck out of everyone the past week on the potential for a recession after a \"bad\" jobs report last Friday. Two top Wall Street banks raised their recession probabilities this week, for example. These pros have voiced their concerns on TV, social media, and in research reports, but they also conveyed them to global trading desks. Markets were pushed into choppy seas as crowded AI trades such as AMD (AMD) have been dumped, with no nod to their underlying fundamentals. All this recession talk feels like BS to me, an excuse to shake out the average investor so institutional players could get back into high-flying names at cheaper prices. Everyone does know that a recession often means negative economic growth, right? Or a significant slowdown in the economy that lasts quarters or even years?So the US economy is going to go from 2. 8% second quarter GDP growth and a long period of steady expansion to slightly negative growth or worse sometime within the next six months? An economy still creating a good clip of jobs each month is going to begin producing job losses in the near future?Where is the evidence to support this? What's the trigger for it? Don't hit me up on X, formerly Twitter, and say it's interest rates because the economy has been doing just fine during this high rate period. Lost in recession BS this week was an ISM services report, which includes data on business activity, new orders, employment, and supplier deliveries. The index clocked in at 51. 4%, up from 48. 8% in June. Numbers over 50% are seen as positive for the economy. Most companies in the report said business was either flat or expanding gradually. Then, initial jobless claims totaled a seasonally adjusted 233,000 for the week — a drop of 17,000. The Street was looking for a print of around 240,000. Corporate earnings season has gone quite well too. The majority of well-known public companies are easily beating sales and profit forecasts, not shocking the masses with giant misses. Outlooks have been solid. That's recessionary? Come on!Now, I am not going to sit here and blow smoke and say everything is peachy. Many households are struggling to make ends meet because of sticky inflation, something I was reminded of when chatting with P&G's (PG) CEO Jon Moeller a week ago. I think the interview by Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma at the NYSE with Dine Brands (DIN) CEO John Peyton was also eye-opening on this front. \"It's a value war. It's a fight for share of wallet. . . . At a time when our target guest is dining out less, we have to make sure that when they do choose to dine out — IHOP or Applebee's or Fuzzy's are their first choice,\" Peyton said. The same goes for DiPalma's exclusive interview with Molson Coors (TAP) CEO Gavin Hattersley. \"Consumers [are] making different pack sizes choices,\" Hattersley said. He said this behavior has been going on \"for a while\" and is \"pretty consistent through through Q2. \"Conversations I had this past week with top leaders further shed light on these macro challenges. Disney (DIS) CFO Hugh Johnston told me demand at its theme parks tailed off in the final few weeks of the quarter. The company sees this slowdown persisting for the next few quarters. \"We certainly see consumers behaving in a way — I wouldn't call it recessionary necessarily — they're watching their pennies a little bit more,\" Johnston said. Lost in the sauce, though, was a strong quarter for Disney's streaming businesses. In a recession, people usually cut unnecessary expenses. Ralph Lauren (RL) CEO Patrice Louvet told me (video above) this when I asked him if the consumer is behaving recessionary: \"I think it's pretty clear wherever you look that the overall consumer is being pressured by the cumulative effect of inflationary pressures and interest rates. As far as our core consumer is concerned, we actually find them to be very resilient. \"The company still notched sales growth in its North American stores. All in all, you don't get the sense the economy has already jumped over a cliff and is falling to the ground. As a result, it's hard to justify some of these severe down days we have witnessed in markets this week. What appears to be unfolding is a gradual cooling in the economy that could prove short-lived, especially if the Fed cuts rates, as Cognizant (CTSH) CEO Ravi Kumar told me on my Opening Bid podcast this week. Labor market developments of late \"seem more consistent with post-reopening normalization and gradual rates drag than any current shock or accelerating weakness but the risk is present,\" said 22V Research strategist Peter Williams in a note this week. I think that's a fair assessment. What's not fair is all this recession hysteria talk.

      "Shareholders asked to approve new ESG policies are warming up to the \"G\" even as they continue withholding support for the \"E\" and \"S. \"\"G\" refers to corporate “governance\" changes, and such proposals received considerably more shareholder support this year than proposals targeting environmental (E) or social (S) changes, according to an analysis of ISS-Corporate data conducted by law firm Freshfields. Of the 154 so-called governance proposals that went to a vote between Jan. 1 and June 14, 38 were successful, according to the analysis. Most that passed called for the elimination of supermajority vote requirements for significant company actions, including at California chip maker Nvidia (NVDA). Other successful proposals required that all directors stand for reelection each year or empowered shareholders to call special meetings. That 25% success rate is considerably higher than E and S proposals that would force companies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, adopt more sustainable supply chain practices, and adopt diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) targets. Just two environmentally focused proposals received majority shareholder backing during the same period measured by Freshfields. The support was even thinner for social proposals. Just one passed, requiring glucose monitoring medical device company DexCom (DXCM) to report its political contributions. That measure received a 52% majority. One possible reason for this divergence is that the G in ESG does not attract the same level of political scrutiny as the E or the S. \"These types of proposals are not considered overly prescriptive on companies and don’t play into any of the backlash to ESG more generally we have seen recently, meaning they tend to have a broader base of support,” said Michael Arnold, a corporate governance attorney with Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP. Both ESG and DEI have been hot-button issues during the 2024 presidential campaign. Former President Donald Trump has promised to banish ESG-minded retirement account investments \"forever,\" while a top Trump ally has called DEI \"bigotry\" against white men. Republican-led states are also pushing companies to rescind race-based employee quotas, piggybacking on the Supreme Court's decision in 2023 to strike down race-based admission policies at Harvard University and the University of North Carolina. This anti-ESG and anti-DEI momentum has forced some companies to peel back some of their existing policies, let alone adopt new ones. Under pressure from shareholders, rural retailer Tractor Supply in June announced that it would retire its DEI goals. Tractor maker John Deere made a similar announcement in July, stating that it would continue to track workforce diversity but end participation in cultural- and social awareness-focused events. But the fact that many E and S proposals were voted down this year may not signal less shareholder interest, according to Freshfields’ Pam Marcogliese. Marcogliese instead suggests that this year's votes could indicate that shareholders have grown more satisfied with companies’ ESG progress and that investors see these latest proposals as too incremental to make a difference. \"Investors maybe don't really think it's worth it because that type of proposal is more about micromanaging the company, rather than really providing more helpful data,\" Marcogliese said. And some of the environmental proposals this season failed only by slim margins. Proposals at Denny’s (DENN), Quest Diagnostics (DGX), and Dine Brands (DIN) came close to receiving majority support, with yes votes hovering around 40%. It should also be noted that there were 51 shareholder proposals that actually opposed companies’ existing DEI efforts — and none of those passed, either. Certainly, shareholders were much more comfortable signing off on certain governance changes. There were 252 such proposals and 38 were successful out of the 154 that went to a vote between Jan. 1 and June 14. Those figures exclude proposals concerning executive compensation. That means that 15% of all governance proposals filed were adopted, up from 7% in 2023, according to Freshfields. For companies included in the Russell 3000, ISS-Corporate said the figure was even higher — at 20% of all proposals filed. The most popular change was to reduce supermajority vote requirements and replace them with simple majority voting standards — a move designed to enhance the rights of shareholders. This was the proposal approved at Nvidia (NVDA). Supermajority vote requirements can make it more challenging to amend a company’s bylaws or charters, making it more difficult to get changes approved. In a recent report — titled \"Are supermajority votes headed for extinction?\" — ISS cited a Tesla (TSLA) vote in 2019 as one example of how supermajority policies can slow things down. That year proposals designed to improve governance practices at the electric vehicle maker received robust support among votes cast, according to ISS, but failed because just 52% of the company’s share capital was represented — as opposed to two-thirds. \"The percentage of S&P 500 companies still employing supermajority rules has declined to just over one third, meaning those retaining the practice increasingly look like outliers and may face more scrutiny and pressure to change,\" ISS said in its report. Not all governance proposals did well this year, however. One notable outlier came with attempts to split the CEO and board chair positions, according to the Freshfields analysis. Of the 44 such proposals, zero passed. Alexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance. Follow Alexis on X @alexiskweed.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. It's a true privilege for me to be here representing Unity as its new Chief Executive Officer. I'd like to begin by sharing some initial observations. Since joining the company a few months ago, I've had the opportunity to visit and learn from our teams around the world. I've relished the time spent connecting with our customers and our community. Although not one of us believes that Unity is currently performing to its potential, I can tell you with complete confidence that we have everything we need to achieve healthy, sustainable, and profitable growth. Our vision for Unity is clear. We believe we can become the only company truly capable of supporting game developers through the entire product life cycle from the prototyping of a new game to that magic moment where our creation meets its players, our technology, our people, our deep partnerships provide an incredibly strong foundation, and we're operating in large and vibrant markets. The focus now is on fostering a culture of execution of discipline and accountability. We plan to accelerate the pace of our product innovation, strengthen the bond we have with our customers and community and rapidly add new world-class talent to the team. We understand what needs to be improved, and we're making the necessary changes to our leadership, our products and our processes with a real sense of urgency. Video games are my passion. I started out as a kid playing Dungeons & Dragons with my friends. I never believe that I'd be lucky enough to be running companies in this industry. I've spent the last 10 years or so working with some of the best game teams in the world, building games in every genre using at least 5 different engines and publishing across every platform. I've also been responsible for helping those games find a global audience and build sustainable growth as live services. During most of that time, I've been a Unity customer on both the Engine and the Advertising side. And while I was at Zynga, quite a significant customer. So I understand deeply the power and promise of the Unity ecosystem. The challenges we currently face at Unity and solution -- and the solutions to those challenges, they're not an abstraction to me. And sitting down with our exceptional teams to implement change is why I'm here. From experience, I can tell you that there is nothing more inspiring and rewarding than helping to bring a great company to its fullest potential. Unity is at its best when we're working hard, sitting side by side with the developers that we've known for nearly 20 years, helping make end market exceptional entertainment. And so we're rededicating ourselves to that original vision. In this next chapter of Unity's history, we're going to become the partners we once were only better, more focused on initiatives that make a tangible difference to our customers and our community every day. Unity 6, the latest update to our game engine is a great example of this commitment to customer needs. It's on track for release this fall, and we believe it will be the most stable, best-performing version we've ever delivered. The preview released in May has already seen significant traction with developers and Unity 6 is going to be the bedrock of our offering for years to come. In our advertising business, we're encouraged by what our customers are telling us about the recent improvements we've made to both our ad networks and our mediation platform. And we're going to complement that good work with a comprehensive rebuild of our machine learning stack and our data infrastructure. We're designing a more agile environment, 1 more conducive to continuous innovation. And this is going to enable us to lower the cost of experimentation, pursue more ambitious and innovative modeling approaches and integrate data from across our product portfolio, which is going to unlock enormous value for our customers. We're also adding world-class talent to help accelerate this transformation on our Ad business. We're pleased today to announce the hiring of Jim Payne as our new Chief Product Officer for advertising. He's a proven innovator and a luminary in the ad tech business, and he understands better than anyone how to -- how publishers create more revenue for their games. And in July, Alex Blum, another experienced ad exec, joined the team as a Senior Vice President of Corporate Development. There's a significant opportunity for growth in our mobile ad business, and these 2 additions will help us realize that opportunity. The entire team is inspired by the challenge of taking its place among the best-performing technology companies in the world. We play a unique role in the ecosystem, sitting at the intersection of mobile, 3D, gaming, AI, data, and digital advertising, with better execution, accelerated product innovation and a renewed focus on delivering for our customers and our community, we will create meaningful long-term value. Before I turn the call over to Luis, I'd like to take a moment to thank him for his contributions over the past 3 years and wish him well in the next chapter of his career. We have appointed Mark Barry Smith, our current Chief Accounting Officer, as our interim CFO. Mark has been with us for more than 2 years and brings a wealth and depth of experience, and I'm confident he'll lead the team through a successful transition. As always, I'd like to thank our customers, our partners and our employees for their ongoing support. I look forward to updating you more on our progress in the time ahead. Luis, over to you. Luis Visoso -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial OfficerThank you, Matt. I would start by saying that it has been a privilege to be Unity CFO for over 3 years. I believe that we have accomplished a lot together as we expanded margins and fixed the portfolio. I want to thank all Unity employees, and particularly those in my organization for supporting me. It has been great to spend the last 3 months with Matt. I have full confidence that he will lead Unity into stronger performance for customers, shareholders, and employees. As he said, we have everything we need to achieve healthy, sustainable, and profitable growth. I'm very happy to pass the baton on to Mark. Mark and I have worked together for many years, and he knows Unity well. I have full confidence in his ability to lead. With that, let me turn on to our results. We're pleased that the second quarter results exceeded guidance for both revenue and adjusted EBITDA and our continued progress on profitability. Revenue from our strategic portfolio was $426 million, down 6% year-over-year. This compares favorably to guidance of $420 million to $425 million. Our GAAP net loss for the quarter was $126 million, a 35% improvement from a net loss of $193 million in the second quarter of 2023. Adjusted EBITDA for the total company for the quarter was $113 million, a 29% improvement from the $88 million delivering the same quarter last year, excluding customer credits in the prior year. This also compares favorably to guidance of $75 million to $80 million as we continue to drive savings and expand gross and operating margins. This quarter, we expanded non-GAAP gross margin to 84% as compared to 81% in the same quarter of the prior year. The gross margin expansion is driven by cost control and better mix while increasing our cloud consumption to train our ML models. We continue to manage operating expenses strategically, making choices where to increase spending, where to keep spending stable and where to continue to drive efficiencies. As a result, non-GAAP operating expenses are down 21% year-over-year and down to 59% of revenue from 63% of revenue in the same quarter of the prior year. Proportionately, the largest reductions come from G&A, followed by sales and marketing. These efforts enabled us to reach adjusted EBITDA margins of 25% for the quarter, an 850 basis point year-over-year increase, excluding onetime customer credits in the prior year. We delivered $80 million in free cash flow in the second quarter, up 137% from $34 million in the prior year. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter were $1. 3 billion. We closed the quarter with 476. 5 million fully diluted shares, slightly down from the prior quarter. This compares favorably to $478 million fully diluted shares in our guidance in the second quarter. I will now provide additional perspective on revenue. Create Solutions revenue from our strategic portfolio in the second quarter was $129 million, up 4% year-over-year. Growth is driven by a 14% increase in subscription revenue as we continue to benefit from our price increase and our customer upgrade to higher-priced subscriptions. Create Solutions strategic revenue is down 2% quarter-over-quarter from reductions in strategic partnerships and professional services following a very strong first quarter in these nonsubscription businesses. Industries continues to be our fastest-growing business. In the second quarter, industries grew 59% year-over-year and now represents 18% of the totals of Create Solutions revenue, up from 12% in the second quarter of '23 and 15% at the end of 2023. Grow Solutions revenue from our strategic portfolio in the second quarter was $296 million, down 9% year-over-year and up 1% quarter-over-quarter. We're pleased with the sequential growth after 2 quarters of sequential revenue declines, which was driven by product improvements and seasonality. On a year-over-year basis, the decline is mainly due to pressures in our monetization business, partially offset by very strong performance from Aura. With that, let me turn to guidance. For the full year, we are adjusting our guidance down, while we're seeing positive impacts from the improvements being made to our Ad Network and LevelPlay products, we now believe that it will take us longer to see the full impact in revenue growth. Our updated revenue guidance for our strategic portfolio is $1,680 million to $1,690 million compared to $1,760 million to $1,800 million previously. This represents a decrease of 2% to 3% year-over-year and a more cautious view of the expected recovery in our Grow business. We expect continued double-digit growth in our Create subscription business. On adjusted EBITDA guidance for the year is $340 million to $350 million compared to $400 million to $425 million in the previous guidance. To reduce the impact of the revenue reduction, we're driving further cost savings in the $5 million to $15 million range, which is included in the guidance. We believe that there are greater efficiencies to be gained over time through a more disciplined execution. For the third quarter, we're guiding revenue to $415 million to $420 million in strategic revenue, down 4% to 6% year-over-year. Consistent with what I just said for the year, we expect our Create subscription business to continue to grow double digits year-over-year and that the Grow turnaround will take longer to materialize. Our adjusted EBITDA guidance for the third quarter is $75 million to $80 million, which includes investments needed to strengthen our Grow business, in addition to the impact of the annual merit increases. Last, we expect 488 million fully diluted shares at the end of the third and fourth quarters. This is a reduction from our prior year-end estimate of 492 million fully diluted shares. As a result, our net year-over-year dilution will be around 2%. The quarter-over-quarter increase in fully diluted share count in the third quarter is entirely driven by our annual equity grants. With that, let me turn the call to Daniel so that we can take your questions. Daniel?Daniel Amir -- Vice President, Investor RelationsThank you. [Operator instructions] So the first question comes from Clark Lampen at BTIG. Clark Lampen -- BTIG -- AnalystThank you very much. Can you guys hear me OK?Matthew Bromberg -- President and Chief Executive OfficerVery well, Clark. Clark Lampen -- BTIG -- AnalystGreat. Matt, I want to start on the ad business. You mentioned sort of in the shareholder letter that you started the process of rebuilding the ML and data stack as we think about sort of the road map from here in terms of releases and general turnaround, could you give us a framework for growth? Is it sort of a quarter's long process? Is this a potentially longer process, what sort of front and center right now in terms of priorities?Matthew Bromberg -- President and Chief Executive OfficerThanks for the question, Clark. Yes, we've been really upping the pace of our product releases on our ad business. And that began before I arrived. We've introduced support for multiple ad units. We've eased integration into our mediation platform. We made countless improvements to our models. And, as Luis mentioned, we are seeing positive reactions from customers. We're encouraged by those updates, and we're going to continue with that pace. At the same time, we do feel like we need to do some more fundamental work, as I mentioned in the letter around our machine learning and data infrastructure stack. Because at the end of the day, while you can make incremental improvements and you've got to compete in this market every day, when you have fundamental capabilities that are differential, that's how you win over the long term. And so we're really excited about the opportunity for that. We have the pieces and we have the data and we have everything we need to do this. We're just going to execute through that activity, relatively quickly. And we're excited about the impact that we think we'll see from that. Clark Lampen -- BTIG -- AnalystUnderstood. That's helpful, Luis. If I can follow up quickly on the guidance. I think just to clarify, you said sort of bridging from the old sort of current guidance we should still expect to create growth of double digits, I think, this year. Is that the right way of thinking about, maybe, medium-term growth for that business also? Or is there a general, I guess, sort of framework for growth, I guess, beyond sort of '24 that we could think about at this stage?Luis Visoso -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial OfficerYes, 2 parts to your answer. One is what I said is that we expect strong double-digit growth from our subscription business within Create. As you know, there are 3 components within Create overall. There is a subscription business. There is professional services and strategic partnerships. Professional services and strategic partnerships will be lumpy as it has always been. Now remember, we had a very strong Q1 and less strong Q2, and it will continue to fluctuate based on our agreement. So you should continue to expect strong growth on the subscription side. I think on your '25 question, it's a little bit premature for us. I mean, I think we need to give Matt a little bit more time. Let us continue to evaluate things, and we'll come back to you and share expectations for next year soon. Clark Lampen -- BTIG -- AnalystSo thank you, guys. Luis Visoso -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial OfficerThank you. Daniel Amir -- Vice President, Investor RelationsThe next question will come from Matt Cost from Morgan Stanley. Matt Cost -- Morgan Stanley -- AnalystHi, everybody. Can you hear me?Luis Visoso -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial OfficerYes. Matt Cost -- Morgan Stanley -- AnalystGreat. Thanks for taking the question. I guess on the growth drivers within Create, I guess, just following up on Clark's question, there's a couple of things that are changing. You've got run time fees coming in with Unity 6. There's the Plus to Pro transition, potentially any price increases for the subscription tiers. I guess, how should we think about when those things layer in and the magnitude of the tailwind to create results either end of this year? Or is that something that starts to flow in next year? And then I have one follow-up. Matthew Bromberg -- President and Chief Executive OfficerYes. Let me -- I'll make an initial observation and then Luis, you can pick up the second half of the question. The first order of business I had when I joined the company was to get out on the road and speak and meet with customers. And I met with individual customers at small groups in New York and also some of our largest customers in the Middle East and Europe. And what I was just really pleased to learn is that there's a real understanding of the important role that we play in the ecosystem and a real excitement around keeping Unity healthy and growing and a real willingness, especially around some of our larger customers to pay fairly for the value we deliver. So that's really great news, and it's a testament to the work everybody does here at Unity every day to keep the company strong. There has been -- there's been a lot coming in on pricing. And one of the things I'll just observe and Luis will take you more into it is that these price increases tend to take time to flow through the system. So they're not something that you see they're related both to the upgrade cycle, for example, of Unity 6 and other things. So -- we don't expect to see them right away, but we do see them coming in over time as you've seen -- as you begin to see already with the subscription growth we have. Luis Visoso -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial OfficerYes. Matt, not a lot to add to what Matt already mentioned, I think we continue to benefit from the price increase we took about 2 years ago, as you know. And what we're seeing very helpful is customers moving to higher-priced SKUs. Now, the industry skew, as we've talked before, has been a great success and has been one of our -- our fastest-growing business and that is, as we've talked before, significantly higher price than that's helping us drive -- bring in more revenue to drive the business. Matt Cost -- Morgan Stanley -- AnalystGreat. And then just quickly, I guess, on the outlook further out, does the Rule of 40 sort of expectation that you laid out a couple of quarters ago, does that still apply? Or is that something that you're reevaluating right now?Matthew Bromberg -- President and Chief Executive OfficerFor us, the Rule of 40 is the right kind of goal, right? It's a goal that's focused on building a business with attractive revenue growth and meaningful profitability and that is what we're focused on. We're focused on delivering long-term sustainable growth, both on the top and the bottom line. It's a little bit too soon for us to be able to forecast exactly when we're going to get there. But it's definitely something we're focused on, and it's important. Matt Cost -- Morgan Stanley -- AnalystOK. Thank you. Daniel Amir -- Vice President, Investor RelationsGreat. So the next question is from Ross Sandler at Barclays. Ross Sandler -- AnalystGreat. Guys, just two questions, Matt. So having used 5 gaming engines as you said earlier in your prepared remarks, any fresh view on beyond the Create Unity 6 product rollout that's happening later this year. Any other kind of alterations or tweaks to the product that would help the go-to market there? And then similarly on the ad side, so Jim obviously knows a lot about what made AppLovin competitive. Do you think that you just kind of need to tinker with these models to get grow to be more competitive? Or are there assets that are out there that are missing from your portfolio that would kind of supercharge the ad business and get you back to the stable and competitive? Thank you. Matthew Bromberg -- President and Chief Executive OfficerYes, it's my pleasure. Thanks for the question. Let's take Create first. What is really important to understand is we really believe that we're in a unique position with Create, with our Engine, not just because it's the best, most performing engines, particularly on mobile and not just because we have such a dominant market share. But because we're -- it's the only -- we're the only company in the world capable of supporting the entire game development cycle. And customers want to see those pieces integrated. They want to see both the ad and marketing side, acquiring players and monetizing them. They want to have one place where they can -- we can -- they can leverage the data that we provide to maximize their business, both in the building and the releasing of games. So that's a really -- we're in a unique position, and we need to execute better to get there, but it's something that nobody else is capable of doing. So it's something we're really focused on, I'm really excited about. On the ad side of our business, you need to do both. So what we have been doing, we're going to continue to do. We're constantly updating our models. We're constantly releasing new products and that's the day-to-day work. But at the same time, we need to be sure that we have the most modern, most performing data and machine learning stack because being able to respond in real time and to be able to leverage the data advantages we have across not just the Engine, not just both of our Ad Networks and 3 or 4 other ad -- or other ad products, we have got to have the largest database and the most knowledge of video and customers among the most knowledge -- anybody in the world -- having the right stack is going to enable us to leverage that value for our customers, and that's going to be really important for the long term, and it's an incredibly important asset and a great opportunity for us. Daniel Amir -- Vice President, Investor RelationsThank you, Ross. The next question comes from Gili from Goldman Sachs. Gili Naftalovich -- Goldman Sachs -- AnalystHi, everyone. Thanks for taking the questions. First off, congratulations to you, Matt. I appreciate the color in the letter. And given your industry experience, I'm curious to hear what your assessment is of Unity's positioning in the broader industry landscape. And how is that influencing the prioritization of initiatives you are putting into place. Can you give us examples of the short-term operational improvements you are taking?Matthew Bromberg -- President and Chief Executive OfficerYes, as I was saying, I think the -- maybe the piece that's least well understood about Unity broadly is just how central we are to the ecosystem and how large that ecosystem is. Some of the things I talked about in the letter. The game economy is most of the app economy, 60% of the app economy. We are touching billions of players through our engine and our ad products. There are hundreds of thousands of Unity developers that you need -- that a game developer can choose from when they decide to build a game. So these ecosystem questions are really, really important and are going to provide a real foundation for us to grow. On the execution side, for us, it's mostly about rapidly creating a culture of execution and accountability. That's most important for us. We're going out and adding world-class talent to add to that culture of execution and Jim is a great example of that. And then we've got to lean into that execution to accelerate the product innovation we're seeing. And if we can do that alongside recreating and deepening bonds with our customers, which some of that has been freight -- gotten a little freight in the past, we want to listen better and be better partners and better customers across our business. If we can do all those things, we are in a very, very nice position. Gili Naftalovich -- Goldman Sachs -- AnalystAppreciate that. If I can, one more for you, Luis. Can you talk through just the guidance reset? And if there was any change to like the linearity in the quarter, I think it was most -- the change was mostly driven off of Grow solutions and added caution. Is that based on the way you're accounting for the timing of your new models to be deployed? Or was there just something in the trends that led you guys to make this change?Luis Visoso -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial OfficerYes. We're just being more cautious, as you said. And I mean when you guide for the full year and you already have 2 quarters, you can see Q3 and Q4, and we're guiding kind of stable Q3 to Q4, mostly right, plus/minus a few millions. So it's pretty stable. So we're not counting with a lot of seasonality in the last quarter. And if it comes, that would be great. But that's just being more cautious on the Grow side. That's really the driver, Gili. Matthew Bromberg -- President and Chief Executive OfficerI just want to add that we're really focused on restoring credibility within our ecosystem with everybody in our ecosystem and taking a prudent approach to forecasting and is important for us, mostly because we're so confident that we're well positioned in the long term, and then we've got a real differentiated offering, but being prudent now is the right approach. Gili Naftalovich -- Goldman Sachs -- AnalystGreat. Thanks. Daniel Amir -- Vice President, Investor RelationsThank you, Gili. The next question comes from Dylan Becker at William Blair. Dylan Becker -- William Blair and Company -- AnalystHey, gentlemen. Just one here for the sake of time. Matt, great to speak with you, and congrats on the next endeavor, Luis here. You guys did call out industry's growth of 60% here, obviously, pretty impressive becoming a larger share of Create. I know Jim had talked a lot about the opportunity there, but wondering if you're seeing kind of incremental traction with partners, scalability, you sold off the piece to cap Jim and of establishing kind of that broader ecosystem, maybe leveraging more SIs. Any kind of additional color there would be great. Matthew Bromberg -- President and Chief Executive OfficerThank you for the question. Yes, we're really excited about the opportunity in industry, and we've -- we're continuing to see real progress there, focus on specific end markets like auto, retail and manufacturing. But, also, really more broadly, anywhere where visualization of 3D assets across devices and platforms is of most value and that's -- those are very broad applications. So we're seeing that demand is really strong. We added a bunch of new customers in Q2, including Audi and Diageo as well as Bosch Rexroth, the German engineering firm. So we are continuing to see growth and velocity there. I'm very, very excited about this as I came in and look just at the at the logos we have and the way this business is expanding, there -- I know Jim was really bullish on it, and we're really lucky to be able to leverage his expertise and continue to do that. But there's a real opportunity in this business for us, and we're leaning into it. Dylan Becker -- William Blair and Company -- AnalystGreat. Thanks, Matt. Daniel Amir -- Vice President, Investor RelationsGreat. The next question is Parker Lane from Stifel. Parker, we can't hear you. Parker Lane -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- AnalystCan you hear me now?Daniel Amir -- Vice President, Investor RelationsYes, we can hear you. Parker Lane -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- AnalystSorry about that, guys. Matt, just a piggyback on Dylan's question there. I was wondering, when you look at the opportunity in industries, is there any significant change in the go-to-market approach or the opportunity set that you guys have historically gone after? I know you've made the shift that Dylan just alluded to in the delivery mechanism. But as far as what you want to go after, is it largely business as usual there?Matthew Bromberg -- President and Chief Executive OfficerI think to Dylan's point, it's -- historically, this business for us has been a lot of pull. So the market demand is there, and we'll become aware of customers using Unity to prototype things and then our sales motion will start and we add customers. So that's spectacular. But it's -- we can complement that go-to-market by building out the motion in a much larger way, through SIs, through other partnerships, we're still really at the relative beginning of that process, which is frankly what's so exciting about it. And we can find the right mix between our own direct sales and going to market with key partners. And again, that's just beginning. So that's what gives us so much confidence. There's a lot of runway here. Parker Lane -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- AnalystGot it. Appreciate the color. Thank you. Daniel Amir -- Vice President, Investor RelationsThank you. And last question will come from Josh Tilton from Wolfe. Josh Tilton -- Wolfe Research -- AnalystThank you so much for squeezing me in. Can you guys hear me?Matthew Bromberg -- President and Chief Executive OfficerYes. Very, well Josh. Josh Tilton -- Wolfe Research -- AnalystTwo questions for me. First of all, Matt, congratulations. I guess what I'm just trying to understand is if I take a lot of the questions that were asked on this call today is, I kind of left the shareholder letter feeling like we have a new starting lineup, but I'm not exactly sure what the playbook is going forward. And I guess if you were to just like summarize broadly in a few sentences, what is the playbook to getting Unity back to greatness and like what can you tell us to give us some confidence to investors that you guys can actually execute on that strategy? And then again, just a follow-up from that question. Matthew Bromberg -- President and Chief Executive OfficerYes. Thanks for the question. So really simply, what we're going to do is we're going to create a culture of execution and accountability and drive forward in a way that is highly differentiated from how we've gone to market in the past. We're going to add world-class talent really quickly. We are bringing new leadership into the company. We're going to listen to our customers better and be more responsive. You're going to see much more product innovation much more quickly. And we're going to share progress with you and -- as we go. So it's been 90 days. We don't want to get too far out in front of the process. But look, it's our strong belief, as I said in the letter, and I said at the top that we are the only company in the world capable of being in this really important space in a very, very large market. So we're well positioned. I can tell you that today, I'm even more excited than the day I started because I can see that the pieces are here. The people are here, the technology is here, the assets are here. Our partners want us to win in both parts of our business. The Ad -- our Ad business, people want us to be a strong competitor. In our Engine business, same thing. So everybody is rooting for us. We have a vision. We've got customers that are rooting for us and we have all the pieces and parts. All we have to do is execute. And that's a position I want to be in because we can execute and we will. And that's why you should have confidence. And you're going to have -- you're going to have to stick with us a little bit here to see how that turns out, but we're really, really confident. Josh Tilton -- Wolfe Research -- AnalystSuper helpful. Then maybe just quick follow-up for me. It feels like there used to be a lot of excitement around the non-gaming Create business. I may be making this up, but I feel like you guys used to talk to the potential for it to be larger than the gaming Create business. you're obviously coming from a gaming background. You seem very focused on fixing the relationship with those gaming customers and improving kind of the ad side of the business as well. So how do we think about investments in the forward trajectory of that non-gaming Create business as you kind of come and sit in this new role?Matthew Bromberg -- President and Chief Executive OfficerYes, great questions. I think, we see our industry business as a natural extension of the capabilities that we develop in the core customer segment in gaming. So I don't see them as at odds. All the technology investments and the product development we do tends to benefit us industry as well. So there's no lot of enthusiasm from our perspective. I do think that over the years, we have talked a lot about, and this goes back to the question on execution. I have full comms that this is going to grow, but we also need to be super clear about our prioritization. And so getting right with our -- in our existing customer segment and executing there is job 1. We have more than enough to go into job 2 around building our industry, again, which is -- we see as a natural outgrowth. So if we can execute better on our go-to-market motion there, which we can and strengthen our core, we can do both at the same time. Josh Tilton -- Wolfe Research -- AnalystSuper helpful. Thank you so much. Matthew Bromberg -- President and Chief Executive OfficerMy pleasure. Daniel Amir -- Vice President, Investor RelationsThank you. So before we wrap up, I wanted to provide Matt for some final words. Matthew Bromberg -- President and Chief Executive OfficerYes. I just want to thank you all for spending the time with us today. As I've shared with you, we believe we have the clarity of vision and all the pieces that we need and we look forward to telling you more about this as we go, and we really appreciate your support, and we look forward to seeing you again soon. Daniel Amir -- Vice President, Investor RelationsThank you. Luis Visoso -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial OfficerThank you.

While Unity Software has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook.

      "Game engine maker Unity (NYSE:U) reported results ahead of analysts' expectations in Q2 CY2024, with revenue down 15. 8% year on year to $449. 3 million. It made a GAAP loss of $0. 32 per share, improving from its loss of $0. 51 per share in the same quarter last year. Is now the time to buy Unity? Find out in our full research report. Revenue: $449. 3 million vs analyst estimates of $441. 7 million (1. 7% beat)EPS: -$0. 32 vs analyst estimates of -$0. 46 (29. 9% beat)Gross Margin (GAAP): 75. 8%, up from 70. 8% in the same quarter last yearFree Cash Flow of $79. 61 million is up from -$14. 56 million in the previous quarterNet Revenue Retention Rate: 96%, down from 101% in the previous quarterMarket Capitalization: $5. 44 billionStarted as a game studio by three friends in a Copenhagen apartment, Unity (NYSE:U) is a software as a service platform that makes it easier to develop and monetize new games and other visual digital experiences. The demand for rich, interactive 2D, 3D, VR and AR experiences is growing, and while the ubiquitous metaverse might still be more of a buzzword than a real thing, what is real is the demand for the tools to create these experiences, whether they are games, 3D tours or interactive movies. As you can see below, Unity's 30. 4% annualized revenue growth over the last three years has been impressive, and its sales came in at $449. 3 million this quarter. This quarter, Unity's revenue was down 15. 8% year on year, which might disappointment some shareholders. Looking ahead, Wall Street was expecting revenue to decline 8% over the next 12 months before the earnings results announcement. Unless you’ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business. While Nvidia and AMD are trading close to all-time highs, we prefer a lesser-known (but still profitable) semiconductor stock benefitting from the rise of AI. Click here to access our free report on our favorite semiconductor growth story. One of the best parts about the software-as-a-service business model (and a reason why SaaS companies trade at such high valuation multiples) is that customers typically spend more on a company's products and services over time. Unity's net revenue retention rate, a key performance metric measuring how much money existing customers from a year ago are spending today, was 96% in Q2. This means Unity's revenue would've decreased by 4% over the last 12 months if it didn't win any new customers. Unity's already weak net retention rate has been dropping the last year, signaling that some customers aren't satisfied with its products, leading to lost contracts and revenue streams. We were impressed by Unity's strong gross margin improvement this quarter. We were also happy its revenue narrowly outperformed Wall Street's estimates. On the other hand, its net revenue retention fell. Overall, this quarter could have been better. The stock remained flat at $14. 25 immediately after reporting. So should you invest in Unity right now? When making that decision, it's important to consider its valuation, business qualities, as well as what has happened in the latest quarter.

      "Identifying overlooked stocks with solid fundamentals can lead to significant returns while investing. Many investors focus on high-profile companies that need more opportunities in less visible sectors. Understanding a company’s financial health, operational efficiency, and cost management can uncover undervalued gems that hit high growth. Here, on the list, the first company excels in iron ore production and cost control, achieving record-high output while managing expenses. This operational prowess positions it as a strong contender for future growth. Meanwhile, the second company maintains robust profit margins and impressive expansion capabilities. Its aggressive store opening strategy and sharp capital expenditures underscore its potential for sustained profitability. Lastly, a third company stands out for its operational efficiencies. These are achieved through workforce reductions and automation. This strategic approach not only reduces costs but also enhances overall performance. Focusing on these fundamental strengths – production efficiency, profit margins, and cost management – can identify stock opportunities that might otherwise go unnoticed. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSource: rafapress / Shutterstock. comVale (NYSE:VALE) specializes in iron ore production and logistics. Its iron ore segment drives its growth potential, evidenced by strong production performance and effective cost management. In the second quarter, Vale saw its highest iron ore production since 2018. This accomplishment underscores the company’s operational improvements. Moreover, Vale shows the capacity to meet growing global demand. The consistent production increase over three consecutive quarters reflects Vale’s strategies. Vale’s C1 cash cost for iron ore was $24. 9 per ton, 6% higher than the previous quarter. The increase was due to seasonal inventory turnover and maintenance activities. Despite short-term cost pressures, Vale’s full-year guidance is between $21. 50 and $23 per ton. The company’s ability to manage costs effectively highlights its operational efficiency. Freight costs decreased to $19 per ton, or $6. 80 lower than the Brazil-China C3 route average. Vale’s long-term affreightment contracts contribute to this cost reduction and enhance overall profitability. In short, Vale is on the overlooked stocks list. This is due to its impressive production performance, effective cost management, and strategic freight cost advantages. Source: rblfmr / Shutterstock. comYum China (NYSE:YUMC) operates a vast network of fast-food restaurants. The company had a core operating profit of $396 million in the first quarter, a 1% increase from the previous year. This increment shows the company’s ability to maintain profitability. The operating profit margin was 12. 6%. Although slightly lower than before, it reflects efficient cost management. Yum China surpassed the 15,000-store milestone and opened 378 net new stores in the quarter. This achievement indicates an aggressive expansion strategy. The rate of store openings has accelerated significantly. Notably, the last 5,000 stores were added in just four years. Flexible store models and strategic investments drive this growth. KFC’s small-town mini model and Pizza Hut’s compact model are examples. These models reduce capital expenditure per store. The average capex for new stores ranges from RMB 1. 2 million ($168,000) to RMB 1. 5 million, and some models cost as little as RMB 0. 5 million. Yum China is notable for its significant store expansion. It maintains high profit margins and efficient capex in new formats. Overall, this makes it a strong contender among overlooked stocks. Source: monticello / ShutterstockUnited Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) offers global logistics and delivery services. The Fit-to-Serve initiative boosts operational efficiency. United Parcel Service reduced its workforce by over 11,500 positions. This cut resulted in approximately $350 million in savings for the first half of 2024. Moreover, the company anticipates $1 billion in savings by the end of the year. Workforce reduction aligns with streamlining operations and enhancing cost-effectiveness. United Parcel Service has also closed 17 operational facilities in Q2. The company plans a total of 35 closures this year. Additionally, automation efforts complement this restructuring. Dispatch process automation cut staffing by 26%. These measures are part of the “Network of the Future” strategy, which focuses on improving operational efficiency and reducing costs. Despite rising union wage rates (up 11. 7%), United Parcel Service managed a 2. 5% cost-per-piece growth rate, the lowest in over three years. Effective expense management and productivity initiatives are key to this achievement. Hence, the lower growth rate highlights United Parcel Service’s cost management capabilities. United Parcel Service is noted as an overlooked stock for operational efficiencies. Workforce reductions and automation are optimizing network operations and cost management.

      "An undeniable fact about equities is that it always remains in a long-term uptrend. In the last ten years, the S&P 500 Index has delivered total returns at a CAGR of 12. 75%. Even if we extend the time horizon, the markets have rewarded investors. The key is good stock selection and the patience to hold. This column discusses seven blue-chip stocks that have underperformed in the recent past but have the potential to surge higher in the long term. This is a good time to look at subdued blue-chip stocks with the index trading near all-time highs. If there is a correction, undervalued blue-chip stocks are unlikely to be significantly impacted. On the other hand, positive business developments will ensure that the upside potential is significant in the coming years. Let’s therefore discuss the fundamental reasons to be bullish on these blue-chip ideas. If difficult to talk about targets, but I can say with some conviction that a portfolio of these stocks can beat index returns in the next five years. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSource: LesPalenik / Shutterstock. comChevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) stock has been sideways in the last 12 months. The key reason is macroeconomic headwinds impacting energy prices. I see this sideways move as a good buying opportunity with the blue-chip stock having strong fundamentals and steady growth visibility. From a fundamental perspective, Chevron has an investment-grade balance sheet. As of the first quarter of 2024, the energy company reported a net debt ratio of 8. 8%. Further, for 2023, Chevron reported operating cash flow of $35. 6 billion. If oil trends are higher on expansionary monetary policies, annual OCF is likely to be more than $40 billion. This positions Chevron to make aggressive capital investments. It’s worth noting that in the last ten years, the average reserve replacement has been over 100%. Once the acquisition of Hess Corporation (NYSE:HES) is closed, production growth and cash flow upside are also on the cards. At the same time, there is likely to be sustained value creation through dividends and share repurchases. Source: ranchorunner / Shutterstock. comAfter remaining subdued for an extended period, Lockheed Martin’s (NYSE:LMT) stock has trended higher by almost 15% in the last month. At a forward P/E of 19. 9x, the defense major remains attractive and offers a dividend yield of 2. 39%. The first point to note is that with rising geopolitical tensions globally, industry tailwinds are likely to remain positive. It’s also worth noting that the company ended the second quarter (Q2) of 2024 with an order backlog of $158 billion. As the backlog swells, revenue growth acceleration is on the cards. For Q2 2024, Lockheed reported year-on-year sales growth of 9% to $18. 1 billion. The company also increased its sales and EPS guidance for the year. Further, free cash flow for 2024 is likely at $6. 2 billion. This provides ample flexibility to invest in dividends and share repurchases. Another growth trigger for Lockheed is investment in next-generation defense technology. This includes areas of hypersonic, and next-generation space capabilities, among others. With high financial flexibility, investment in innovation is likely to be robust. Source: Manuel Esteban / Shutterstock. comPfizer (NYSE:PFE) stock was on a sharp downtrend and touched 52-week lows of $25. 2 in April. However, PFE stock has made a strong comeback from oversold levels and currently trades at $31. At a forward P/E of 12. 9x, the biotech stock remains attractive and offers a dividend yield of 5. 47%. I therefore expect the positive momentum to sustain. Pfizer recently reported strong Q2 2024 results. Revenue increased by 3% on a year-on-year basis to $13. 3 billion. The company also revised its annual revenue guidance upwards to $61 billion (mid-range). An important point to note is that Pfizer has an attractive product pipeline of 113 candidates as of July. This includes 33 and 27 candidates in the third and second phases respectively. In the next few years, the pipeline will provide growth visibility. I must add that in December 2023, Pfizer completed the acquisition of Seagen. This positions Pfizer among the leading oncology companies and will contribute to growth acceleration. Source: Rob Bayer / Shutterstock. comRio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) is possibly among the best industrial commodity stocks to buy. At a forward P/E of 8. 9x, RIO stock looks undervalued and offers a healthy dividend yield of 6. 72%. With expansionary monetary policies on the cards, I expect a rally for industrial commodities and Rio is positioned to benefit. It’s worth noting that Rio has continued to report healthy numbers. For the first half of 2024, the commodity company reported EBITDA and operating cash flow of $12. 1 billion and $7. 1 billion respectively. Further, with a strong balance sheet, Rio is positioned to make aggressive investments. Between 2024 and 2026, the company plans to make annual investments of $7 billion. An important point to note is that the iron ore segment continues to drive cash flows. However, Rio is diversifying into energy transition metals like aluminum, copper and lithium, among others. The diversification is likely to yield results in the next five years. Source: Piotr Swat/ShutterstockReturns from Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) stock have been unimpressive in the last five years. However, with gold trending higher, I am bullish on a strong breakout for NEM stock. It’s worth noting that a forward P/E of 16. 2x looks attractive for this 2. 12% dividend yield stock. Currently, gold is trading just above $2,400 an ounce. However, Citi believes that the precious metal can trade at $3,000 an ounce in the next 6 to 18 months. If this holds, I expect healthy returns from NEM stock during this period. From an asset perspective, Newmont has ten tier-one gold assets that are likely to support production growth through 2040. At the same time, the company has 14 million tons and 26 million tons of copper reserves and resources respectively. These assets provide clear growth visibility and with potentially higher realized price, cash flows will swell. For Q2 2024, Newmont reported operating cash flow of $1. 4 billion. If gold indeed trades above $3,000 an ounce, annual OCF is likely to be in the range of $7 to $10 billion. This will translate into healthy dividend growth. Source: Cassiohabib / Shutterstock. comConsumption spending remains the growth driver for the U. S. economy. This has been impacted to some extent by tight monetary policies. However, with growth concerns, rate cuts are likely and I am bullish on the consumption sector. The Home Depot (NYSE:HD) stock has remained subdued in line with challenging macroeconomic conditions. I see current levels as a good buying opportunity for this 2. 49% dividend yield stock. A key growth trigger for Home Depot is the acquisition of SRS Distribution. The latter is one of the fastest-growing building products distributors in the United States. With the completion of the acquisition, the company’s total addressable market has increased by $50 billion to $1 trillion. This will have a positive impact on growth in the coming quarters. For 2024, Home Depot has guided for a 1% decline in comparable store sales. This factor is however discounted in the stock and growth acceleration is likely towards the end of the year. This will translate into an upside for HD as its standing improves among blue-chip stocks. Source: rafapress / Shutterstock. comVale (NYSE:VALE) stock has witnessed a deep correction year-to-date. I see this as a golden buying opportunity with the commodity stock trading at a forward P/E of 5x. In my view, VALE stock can double from current levels in the next 24 to 36 months. Recently, Vale reported results for Q2 2024 and there were several positives. First, iron ore production and sales have been on an uptrend. At the same time, copper production has been stable. While nickel production has declined, it’s on the back of maintenance. Further, pro-forma EBITDA for Q2 2024 was $4 billion. Higher iron ore shipments boosted the company’s EBITDA. If commodities trend higher in the coming quarters, the annual EBITDA potential is likely to be $20 billion. Vale is therefore positioned to deliver healthy operating and free cash flows. This will ensure a strong balance sheet and flexibility for dividends, making it one of the best blue chip stocks to buy.

      "VALE S. A. (VALE) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks. com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term. Shares of this company have returned -6. 6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1. 1% change. The Zacks Mining - Iron industry, to which VALE belongs, has lost 2. 7% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making. Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock. Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements. VALE is expected to post earnings of $0. 54 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -18. 2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -11. 7%. For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2. 13 points to a change of +16. 4% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -2. 1%. For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2. 14 indicates a change of +0. 5% from what VALE is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -3. 6%. Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, VALE is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial. In the case of VALE, the consensus sales estimate of $11. 06 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +4. 1%. The $40. 88 billion and $42. 67 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -2. 2% and +4. 4%, respectively. VALE reported revenues of $9. 92 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +2. 6%. EPS of $0. 43 for the same period compares with $0. 20 a year ago. Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9. 97 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0. 46%. The EPS surprise was +13. 16%. Over the last four quarters, VALE surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period. No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance. Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is. As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued. VALE is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade. The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks. com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about VALE. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "If we look at the returns of various asset classes in the last twenty years, commodities are the most undervalued. During this period, the Bloomberg Commodity Index has delivered negative returns at a CAGR of 0. 4%. Of course, this has been amidst volatility, but there is a strong case for healthy returns from commodities in the next five to ten years. From an investment perspective, it’s a good time to consider undervalued industrial commodity stocks. Besides the long-term factor, there is another reason to be positive on industrial commodities. The world is moving towards expansionary monetary policies, and a Federal Reserve interest rate cut can trigger a rally in commodities. The reasons are a potentially weaker dollar coupled with demand growth visibility in a low interest rate regime. Therefore, let’s discuss three undervalued industrial commodity stocks that can surge higher. The ideas discussed have the potential to deliver 100% returns within the next 24 to 36 months. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSource: ShutterstockVale (NYSE:VALE) is among the most undervalued industrial commodity stocks to buy for robust returns. The stock trades at a forward price-earnings ratio of 4. 9 times, and the valuation gap is likely to close once commodities trend higher. Besides the valuation factor, VALE stock offers an attractive dividend yield of 10. 94%. Recently, Vale reported Q2 2024 results, and there were several positives. First, the commodity company reported a 7% year-on-year increase in iron ore shipments to 80Mt. At the same time, copper production remained stable. While nickel production declined, it was due to maintenance. It’s also worth noting that Vale reported an adjusted EBITDA of $4 billion. If commodities trend higher in the coming quarters, the commodity major will be positioned to report an annual EBITDA of $18 to $20 billion. Therefore, overall business fundamentals remain strong. I must add that Vale is focusing on energy transition metals like copper and nickel. This diversification is likely to yield positive results in the long term. Source: BalkansCat / Shutterstock. comRio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) is another undervalued commodity stock offering a healthy dividend yield of 6. 69%. It’s worth noting that RIO has returned (capital gains) 18% in the last five years. The more the recent correction has been for an extended period. However, Rio has a strong balance sheet, and business developments remain positive. I would expect much better returns in the next five years. From a financial perspective, Rio Tinto has delivered impressive numbers. Between 2019 and 2023, the company reported an average annual EBITDA of $26. 6 billion. The average annual free cash flow has been $7. 7 billion for the same period. High financial flexibility allows the commodity major to make aggressive investments. For Rio Tinto, the iron ore business remains the cash cow. However, the company has diversified, with interests in copper, aluminum, lithium, and titanium, among others. Strategic investments in metals that support global energy transition are favorable for long-term value creation. Source: MICHAEL A JACKSON FILMS / Shutterstock. comAmidst the volatility, Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) stock has remained sideways in the last 12 months. I see this consolidation as a good accumulation opportunity before the next big rally in this copper mining stock. Recently, Freeport reported results for Q2 2024. During the quarter, the company produced one billion pounds of copper, 443,000 ounces of gold, and 20 million pounds of molybdenum. While the business is diversified, copper remains the key cash flow driver. For 2024, Freeport has guided for an operating cash flow of $7. 2 billion. With capital investment plans of $3. 7 billion for the year, ample cash flows for dividends and share repurchases will be available. It’s worth noting that for 2025, Freeport has guided for capital investments of $4. 1 billion. This is likely to be associated with an increase in copper and molybdenum sales. An important point is that “green uses of copper had a 4% share in copper consumption in 2020. ” This share is expected to more than quadruple to 17% by 2030. Therefore, as the world works towards a net-zero emission target, the demand for copper will continue to swell.

Southern Copper reported a 78. 1% year-over-year surge in zinc sales volumes.  Molybdenum volumes were up 21. 4%, silver volumes improved 31. 6% and copper sales volumes were up 5. 5%. The rise in sales volumes as well as higher prices for copper (15%), molybdenum (3. 9%), zinc (12. 2%) and silver (19%) drove the increase in sales. The cost of sales rose 9% year over year to $1. 25 billion. Total operating costs were up 8% year over year to $1. 5 billion. Southern Copper Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Southern Copper Corporation QuoteOperating profit was $1. 6 billion, reflecting a 78. 5% year-over-year improvement.

This was driven by an increase in production at the company’s Peruvian operations due to higher ore grades. Copper sales were up 5. 5% year over year to 231,105 tons. Molybdenum: The company mined 7,654 tons of molybdenum, reflecting a year-over-year improvement of 21%, driven by higher output at all operations, barring La Caridad, as well as higher ore grades and recoveries. Molybdenum sales were 7,640 tons, a 21. 4% increase from 6,295 tons in the second quarter of 2023. Zinc: The company’s zinc production surged 73% year over year to 29,419 tons attributed to the contribution from the new Buenavista zinc concentrator.

Sales increased 31. 6% year over year to 5. 3 million ounces.

Teck Resources TECK reported second-quarter 2024 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 58 cents, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 47 cents by a margin of 23%. The bottom line marked a 37% plunge from earnings of 91 cents per share reported in the year-ago quarter. Gains from increased copper sales from QB, elevated copper prices and higher steelmaking coal sales volumes were offset by lower steelmaking coal prices. Finance and depreciation and amortization expenses increased year over year, as Teck Resources has started taking the depreciation of QB assets into account and is no longer capitalizing interest on the project. The decline in earnings was also attributed to the reduced ownership in Elk Valley Resources, TECK’s steelmaking coal business. Freeport-McMoRan Inc. FCX reported adjusted EPS of 46 cents in the second quarter, which topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 39 cents. The bottom line was 31% higher than the year-ago quarter’s EPS of 35 cents.

The figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,985. 9 million. The company witnessed higher copper and gold prices in the quarter, which helped offset the impact of lower sales volumes.

The bottom line marked a 115% surge from earnings of 20 cents per share reported in the year-ago quarter.

Pro-forma adjusted EBITDA (including associates and joint ventures and excluding expenses related to Brumadinho) was down 6% year over year to approximately $4 billion. The downfall was mainly due to higher costs and expenses, which were partially offset by improved iron ore sales. The Iron Solutions segment’s adjusted EBITDA was $3. 89 billion, which was 5% lower than the second quarter of 2023, mainly reflecting higher freight costs and the impact of maintenance activities to improve performance in the second half of 2024. Energy Transition Metals’ EBITDA was down 14% to $407 million compared with $476 million in the year-ago quarter. Copper operations witnessed a 49% year-over-year improvement in adjusted EBITDA to $351 million attributed to increased sales volumes and prices that offset increased  maintenance costs of both Salobo and Sossego operations. Adjusted EBITDA for nickel slumped 54% year over year to $108 million due to declining average prices and lower volumes sold. Vale exited the second quarter with cash and cash equivalents of around $6. 48 billion compared with $5 billion at the end of the prior-year quarter. Cash flow generated from operations was $1. 2 billion compared with $1. 9 billion in the year-ago quarter. Gross debt and leases at the end of the quarter were $15. 1 billion compared with $13. 9 billion at the end of the second quarter of 2023. Vale has recently entered into a partnership to build an iron ore concentration plant in Sohar, Oman. It is expected to start operations in 2027. The plant will have an initial production capacity of 12 Mtpa of high-grade iron ore concentrates, primarily suitable for direct reduction agglomerates, and will feed Vale’s pellet plants and future briquette plants in the region. The partner will wholly own and operate the plant and Vale will invest in the infrastructure to connect the concentration plant to its agglomeration facilities in the region. This is an important step in Vale’s strategy to develop low-carbon solutions for the steel industry. The company aims to replicate this asset-light investment model for metallics production in the Mega Hubs. In April, Vale completed a strategic partnership with Manara Minerals, a joint venture between Ma’aden and Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund. Manara invested $2. 5 billion for a 10% equity interest in Vale Base Metals Limited (“VBM”), the holding company of Vale’s Energy Transition Metals business. The Onça Puma nickel mine and the Sossego copper mine resumed operations in June after the Pará State environmental authority reinstated their operating licenses. The Salobo 3 processing plant operations restarted in July, after being suspended for 31 days due to a fire at the conveyor belt.

We caution you that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties. To obtain information and factors that may lead to results different from those forecast by Vale, please consult the reports Vale files with the U. S.

Now, I will turn the conference over to Mr. Eduardo Bartolomeo. Sir, you may now begin. Eduardo de Salles Bartolomeo -- Chief Executive OfficerOK. Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Here we are at the halfway mark of 2024. So let's take a look at the progress we've made on our key levers to unlock value at Vale. Starting with our Safety journey, we are very pleased to inform that we have eliminated the B3/B4 dam, and we were able to achieve this one year ahead of the original schedule. We are working on two additional structures to be eliminated in 2024. By the end of this year, we will have completed more than 50% of our decharacterization program, a significant milestone. On our second level, we continue to see progress on iron ore operational stability with consistent performance and the third consecutive quarter of year-over-year increase in production. Before you buy stock in Vale, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Vale wasn’t one of them.

See the 10 stocks »*Stock Advisor returns as of July 22, 2024Our C1 cost that was seasonally higher in the second quarter, is on track to reach our guidance of $21. 5 to $23 per ton for the year, especially as our product mix and fixed cost dilution improves in the second half. On iron ore growth and quality, Vargem Grande is on its way to start up in the next months, and the Capanema project is on track for the middle of next year for a combined capacity addition of 30 million tons. We approved the Sohar concentration plant, this will serve as a pilot project of our Mega Hubs strategy, which will redefine industry supply chains, foster additional demand for high-quality pellet feed and position Vale as the world's most competitive direct reduction concentrate supplier. In Energy Transition Metals, our Onca Puma, Sossego, and Salobo plants have also resumed operations with no impact on our guidance for the year. We recently announced the new CEO of Vale Base Metals. Shaun Usmar brings his extensive mining experience and strategic vision to lead the Company throughout its value creation pathway. In our pursuit toward ESG Leadership in mining, we are reinforcing our commitment to transparent disclosure with the adoption of TNFD and ISS. On capital allocation, we recycle capital, increasing the maturity of our debt. And yesterday, we announced an interest on capital of $1. 6 billion related to our first half of '24 performance according to our dividend policy. Now let's go into the details of these highlights. Next slide. On dam safety, we concluded the decharacterization of B3/B4 dam, one of the dams that was put at the highest emergency level in 2019. Dikes 1A and 1B are the other two structures to be eliminated this year, after which we will have completed 53% of our decharacterization program. This is pioneer process, and we are gaining experience and expertise, which is helping us to advance well. We remain committed to the elimination of all upstream dams in Brazil in a safe and conservative manner. Next slide, please. On iron ore production, we delivered robust operational performance once again, the third consecutive quarter of year-over-year increase in production. This is a direct result of our efforts to improve the reliability and stability of our assets and processes as per our management model. S11D achieved a historical production record for a second quarter and the asset is a fundamental piece of our strategy for growing high-quality products in our portfolio. The S11D plus 20 million tons expansion project is scheduled to start up in 2026 and will support production growth. Finally, I would like to highlight our sales, which grew 7% year over year, reflecting our strong performance. The result of the first semester reinforces our confidence and commitment to meet the top end of our 2024 guidance. This demonstrates that Vale now has a business with much greater predictability, providing a solid foundation for the future. Next slide. Our key iron ore projects are underway to increase capacity. In the next 12 months, we have two main projects coming online. The Vargem Grande project to start up in the coming months will add 15 million tons per year of high-quality iron ore capacity with a very low capex investment. The Capanema project is progressing well, with the precommissioning activities initiated, and will also bring an additional 15 million tons per year of high-quality ore capacity after the first half of 2025. Next slide. Advancing on our long-term strategy, we signed an important agreement to develop the concentration plant in Sohar, a project presented during Vale Day in December. The Sohar concentration plant will significantly increase the availability of high-quality pellet feed by 12 million tons per year. This will enable us to produce feed for direct reduction agglomerates, enhancing our operational capabilities and product offerings. This asset-light business model has a low investment obligation from Vale and an internal rate of return exceeding 30%, making it a highly accretive investment. This partnership will serve as a model for future mega hubs in the region and pave the way for a more sustainable future, allowing the production of metallics through low CO2 emission routes. It marks the first significant step toward new developments to come. Next, please. Now moving to the Energy Transition Metals business. Looking at our Copper performance, despite the headwinds in the quarter, we had a 5% increase in production in our plants in Brazil. On Nickel, production reflected our planned maintenance strategy, and we are on track to deliver the production guidance for 2024. In Sudbury, improved mine performance resulted in reduced consumption of third-party feed and lower costs. We are confident that we're putting together a great team as seen on the appointment of Shaun as CEO and taking the right steps to transform the Energy Transition Metals business. Next slide. On our ESG strategy, we want to reduce our impacts generating positive outcomes for nature and people. For that, we have three main pillars to support our nature actions. First, keep the first that we have standing. At Vale, we protect 11 hectares for every one hectare affected by our activities. In 2019, we committed to increasing protected areas by 500,000 hectares, and we are already at 35% of this target. The second pillar is bioeconomy and create a business environment favorable to the conservation of native forests. And our third pillar is to fight extreme poverty, which will help avoid the legal exploitation of land. Our strategy led us to prioritize the adoption of TNFD and ISSB. We believe this will help our stakeholders to better understand and assess companies on their ESG progress. Before we move to our financial results, I would like to comment that we are delivering on our commitments. Our strong operational performance continues quarter after quarter and we are in a very good shape for the second half of 2024. Now, I'll pass the floor to Gustavo to comment on the financial performance, and I'll get back to you on the Q&A. Thank you. Gustavo Pimenta -- Executive Vice President, Finance and Investor RelationsThank you, Eduardo, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with our EBITDA performance in the quarter. As you can see, our pro forma EBITDA reached $4 billion in Q2, driven by strong operational performance across all commodities. This is a result of our continued focus on operational excellence and asset reliability, and the record iron ore production in Q2 since 2018 is a testament of that. As part of our asset integrity program, we had a concentration of maintenance activities in Q2, particularly in April, which, together with inventory turnover effect and higher freight rates more than offset higher iron ore sales in the quarter. The good news is that our C1 significantly declined by the end of Q2, while rising volumes in the North, coupled with reduced maintenance works in the second half provide us with a solid run rate to deliver a strong operational performance in the coming quarters. I will go into the details of our C1 dynamics in the next slides. On a sequential basis, our pro forma EBITDA increased 15%, driven by 25% higher shipments, partially offset by higher operating costs and lower realized iron ore prices. Now I would like to provide more color on our realized all-in premiums for the quarter. Vale has many sites and a broad product portfolio, ranging from high silica products that trade at discounts compared to the benchmark to direct reduction pellets with a 67% iron ore content. Typically, high silica products from the southern and southeastern systems are blended with Carajas to create our main product, BRBF. This is a premium product with low alumina and 5% silica content. As the average silica content naturally increases in the Southern and Southeastern systems, we have been using a higher proportion of Carajas in the blend, implying increased availability of high silica products to be sold directly in the market. This higher availability is even more pronounced in the first half of the year due to the production seasonality in the Northern System. On top of that, based on product availability, we evaluate commercial options cargo-by-cargo, aiming to maximize value, either by concentrating these products in China, selling them directly or holding the inventory. In Q2, with quality discounts below historical levels, direct sales were the most attractive option with an EBITDA per ton of around $20. As a consequence, our realized all-in was actually $0. 1 per ton negative despite 7% of the portfolio being sold with premiums above the benchmark. In the second half of 2024, we anticipate a reduction in the share of high silica products in our mix due to the increased production in the north, supporting better premiums. More importantly, looking into the coming years, the share of high silica products in the sales mix should gradually decline with the start-up of growth projects like Vargem Grande, Capanema, and particularly, the S11D expansion. In addition, the development of concentration plants like the one in Sohar will also contribute to structurally reduce our share of high silica products. Now let me turn to our cost performance. In iron ore, our C1 cash costs, excluding third-party purchases, was $24. 9 per ton in the quarter, mainly impacted by an inventory turnover effect as expected for a second quarter. This is how the inventory effect works. Vale has an extensive supply chain and around 30% of our sales in the quarter are composed by inventories from the previous quarter. Also, we note that production costs in Q1 are usually the highest in the year given lower fixed-cost dilution. As a result, in Q2, the difference in inventory cost impacted C1 by $1. 8 per ton sequentially. In this quarter's financial report, we have started to disclose our production costs per ton in order to provide a better view on our C1 cash cost trends. We remain highly confident in achieving our guidance for 2024 of $21. 5 to $23 per ton. Our production cost in June, excluding inventory effects was already significantly down, reaching $22 per ton. This is a solid indicator of our potential in the second half of the year with benefits from greater cost dilution, increased production in the Northern System, and reduced maintenance activities during the dry season. Now moving to our Energy Transition Metals business. We were pleased to have another quarter of significant year-on-year reduction in our all-in cost in nickel, which were down 12% to $15,000 per ton. This is mostly due to lower third-party feed purchases as well as by a reduction in expenses as we wrote down some high-cost inventories in Q2 '23. With Q1 and Q2 all-in cost averaging less than $15,000 per ton, we are well-positioned to reach our 2024 all-in guidance of $14,500 to $16,000 per ton this year. In copper, all-in costs increased 18% year on year to about $3,600 per ton, driven by increased unit COGS due to maintenance at Salobo and Sossego. All-in costs average about $3,500 per ton in first-half 2024, below our 2024 all-in guidance range of $4,000 to $4,500 per ton. Now moving on to cash generation. Free cash flow generation was $0. 2 billion negative in Q2, impacted by a higher concentration of payments to suppliers, high execution of concession contract obligations, and lower accounts receivable following the 4. 3 million tons of iron ore sales accrued at the end of the quarter. We expect working capital to positively reverse in the second half. Still, our cash and cash equivalents increased by $3. 1 billion in Q2. This increase was primarily driven by the $2. 5 billion proceeds received following the Vale Base Metals partnership as well as by the issuance of $1 billion in bonds in June, mostly used for liability management in July. Our capital expenditures were flat quarter on quarter at $1. 3 billion and we're on track to meet our capex guidance of around $6. 5 billion for the year. Also yesterday, our board of directors approved a distribution of $1. 6 billion in interest on capital to be paid in September this year, reinforcing our continued commitment to return value to our shareholders. Before moving on to the Q&A session, I would like to reinforce the key messages from today's call. Safety and their management continue to be a key priority for Vale, and we are encouraged by the progress in our decharacterization program, having fully decharacterized the B3/B4 dam. Our strong operational performance continues to be seen quarter after quarter, and we are on track to deliver our production and cost guidance for the year. In fact, on iron ore, we are now very confident on reaching the top end of the 310 million to 320 million tons production guidance range. On our strategic objective to be the supplier of choice for low-carbon steel production, we are very pleased with the advancement of Sohar concentration partnership in Oman, which will serve as a pilot for the upcoming Mega Hub projects with very attractive returns. At VBM, our cost performance has been solid so far in the year, and we see room for continued improvement, particularly as the asset review plan is gradually executed. Lastly, we remain highly committed to disciplined capital allocation, controlling expanded net debt within our target, taking advantage of asset-light growth opportunities, and rewarding shareholders with solid remuneration through dividends and buybacks. Now, I would like to open the call for questions. Thank you. Operator[Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Daniel Sasson with Itau BBA. You can open your microphone. Daniel Sasson -- Itau BBA -- AnalystHi everyone. Good morning. Thank you so much for taking my questions. My first question, maybe to Gustavo. If you could please provide us an update on the ongoing negotiations with the government regarding the resell for Samarco, where we are right now, the back and forth with the government. Where do you think the most important points of this agreement are, that would help us. I mean I think we -- it could be an important catalyst for stock price performance once this gets solved. And my second question is regarding your portfolio mix. You mentioned that you expect 65% of high-quality products in your portfolio in the second half versus 59% in the first half with high silica declining to 10% of sales. Regarding specifically your strategy for the high silica portion, do you -- the decline expect ahead comes on the back of reduced inventories of that type of product? Or do you see maybe discounts increasing for that portion? My point is, is that a matter of what you have of high silica products to be sold being lower or less volumes than you had in the beginning of the year? Or that reflects your view that high silica products should demand a higher discount in the second half of this year versus the first half? Thank you so muchGustavo Pimenta -- Executive Vice President, Finance and Investor RelationsGood morning. Sasson, Gustavo here. So I'll take the first one and then Spinelli will go over your second question. So [Inaudible] Mariana, we continue to be optimistic about the ability and the possibility to settle the agreement. All parties are highly engaged. The view is that in the next -- you continue to have a view that in the next couple of months, we'll be able to reach a resolution, both in terms of the actual agreement, the text associated with the agreement and also the key financial terms. So this is important for the Company, and we see a momentum from all parties to be able to sit down and settle this. So we are optimistic in our expectations that in the next couple of months we'll be able to resolve this. So I'll pass the second question to Spinelli. Marcello Spinelli -- Executive Vice President, Iron Ore SolutionsThank you, Daniel. Structurally, we have the high silica in our portfolio. After Brumadinho, we have this imbalance in our mix. So after -- as you saw in the initial remarks, after the ramp-up of S11D we'll have the main component of the BRBF IOCJ. So we can reduce -- minimize this kind of product stand-alone. So you asked me what is the reason we are doing this. So as we saw in the initial remarks, we can't -- we just don't sell it. But we have a market for that. So until May, we sell directly, the gap was really widened when you compare the high grade and the low grade. Since the end of May, we start to concentrate the most we can. So we have a capacity to produce 18 million to 20 million tons in China. We have a remaining high silica to handle so that's the reason why we are -- we expect to have 10% in our portfolio. That's the same level we expect for next year. And with the -- always saying that depends on market conditions, if we have a better discount for high silicon, we can sell directly. That's the influence. So just to set your model, you may consider this 10%. And gradually, in '26, '27, we must go to 0%. OperatorNext question from Rodolfo Angele with J. P. Morgan. You can open your microphone. Rodolfo Angele -- AnalystOK. Hi. Good morning. My two questions are the following. First, it's really good to see management positive and the evolution of costs and making sure guidance is reached. But this is a theme that's been more and more recurring when we speak to investors, and I just wanted to hear from you, aside from things such as higher volume, which is seasonally the rule in the second half of the year, particularly in the third quarter. What is this structural? What can be done? What's in your hands that we can see to make the path of costs coming down as expected and we hope eventually even lowering into '25 and onwards. So that's question number one. The second is a bit more about where we stand in prices versus the strategy -- successful strategy on the stabilization of the iron ore business. Of course, as per Spinelli's answer right now, the commercial strategy will follow market conditions, right? So what we've been seeing is an effort to lower, to fight back seasonality. And we saw, since first quarter, very strong production reports. And of course, we are entering the period of even higher volumes. But how should we think about volumes in a scenario of prices as today are slightly below $100 per ton. Does that change anything? And how do you think about it? What can we expect if prices continue for a while as soft as they are right now?Gustavo Pimenta -- Executive Vice President, Finance and Investor RelationsSo, Rodolfo, Gustavo here. So I'll do the first one, again and Spinelli will go over the second one. So certainly, I think we've been the last, call it, two years looking structurally at our cost base. And implementing a series of initiatives being new technologies in the field, revisiting process, increasing the share of preventive maintenance as compared to corrective maintenance. All of that over time, should make our costs more efficient. And so, we are seeing this already as we look into the numbers. Certainly, the dilution effect for Vale given the expanded fleet that we have, it's super helpful, right? The ability for us to bring volume with very limited capital helps a lot. But we are not just counting on that. We're also looking structurally in areas where we think we can extract more value from the business. And we are seeing results already as we look into the business. So I'll pass the second question to Spinelli. Marcello Spinelli -- Executive Vice President, Iron Ore SolutionsRodolfo, thank you for your question. So we don't see a support in the cost curve for a major decline at this moment. Definitely, we have a pressure of inflation, freight and now we see starting the impact coming from the green world, and that's the pattern we have. We have our long-term price of around 90%. So this is the first direct answer for your question. But one thing you should pay attention. So we see a balanced market at this moment. One of the micro indicators of -- everybody ask us about is the inventory -- iron ore inventory in the port side. I want to drag your attention for some information, actual information about this. Firstly, we've been, Vale, not only Vale, our competitors also, changing the way we are doing business. So we are improving the production of BRBF. So we have a nonoperational or non-for-sale inventory. Our competitors are screening the products, so increasing the blending. We are increasing the concentration now in the second half. So this 160 million tons when you compared to last year is like 145 million tons. And there's another point that most of the increase came from low-grade ores, as you mentioned, we have the mantra of margin over volume. But if you pay attention in the lower level of IOCJ, and that's the reason the gap is widening the low-grade ore and high-grade ore. The premium in Carajas is higher now. So again, that's the balance. As a whole, we see the market balance. Pay attention that the port inventory is not a proxy directly at this moment with the demand and we should track this instability or we feel China all the time. We like to pray for extra steam, but we have a very strong new normal in China. That is supported by manufacturing exports is something every time we are worried about because we don't see yet the countries fighting against some product, but it's something that is structured. We have a new global, new ties, in this geopolitics. So for this year, so far, so good. We see China with this level of production for next year. We see a stability in terms of demand. But obviously, we need some more figures about how can we reduce this, our concerns about the decline of properties in China. But so far, so good for '24 and '25, we are in a good shape in the balanced market. OperatorNext question from Myles, also with UBS. You can open your microphone. Myles Allsop -- UBS -- AnalystGreat. Thank you very much for the question. So a couple of things. First of all, on M&A. Obviously, there are some assets available, nickel assets available in Brazil. Just wondering how you're thinking about M&A, is this the right point to be sort of right point in the cycle to be picking up assets in that commodity. And then secondly, could you just talk a bit more about value over volume. So if China is softer than you expect from a demand perspective, what price point do you expect the majors, including yourself to start curtailing production to support pricing?Gustavo Pimenta -- Executive Vice President, Finance and Investor RelationsMyles, Gustavo here. So for that particular question on nickel in Brazil, we are not looking at those. And I think the way we always articulate and this is the way we think about M&As, as you know, we have a very large endowment at Vale. So our preference has been to develop our own endowment in the commodities that we like and the ones that we operate well, and looking at opportunities that are win-win type opportunities. You've seen us doing a deal last year buying 15% of Minas-Rio, with the possibility to go to 30%. So those are the things we like. It's highly accretive and it's right there at what we want to do long term in terms of a strategic position. But for those particular assets that we just mentioned, we are not looking at that. So I'll turn to Spinelli for the second question. Marcello Spinelli -- Executive Vice President, Iron Ore SolutionsThank you, Myles, for the question. So two sides here. The first, the cost curve. We -- if you move lower than $100 to $90, we see 100 million tons outside of market. So we really see a support. We don't see a support in the balance to the market below that. On the other hand, in the demand side, you mentioned China. We have a positive eye on China when we see this new normal that we call the Chinese economy resiliency. Again, the new norm is based on manufacturing. It's based on export. We see infrastructure play an important role offsetting the decline of properties. Obviously, we see -- we may pay attention for two main points. That's our concern. And probably you're concerned that is -- the level of export, mainly the steel directly, for us, is as a temporarily part, but today is reaching almost 100 million tons. On the other hand, we have a new geopolitics tie. So we don't see the same ties as we've been seeing in the last years. Now we have other players, big players that can support demand from China. And we need to remind that ex-China is growing this year 4%. Emerging markets, including Southeast Asia, India, Middle East is growing really high. So all of this together, we have to pay attention in terms of inflation, how the countries are accepting this new products from China, and it's so far so good. But don't see domestic market is declining due to the properties. But all this mix is supporting this high demand, at least for this year, next year in our analysis. OperatorNext question from Carlos De Alba with Morgan Stanley. You can open your microphone. Carlos De Alba -- AnalystHello. Good morning everyone. Thank you very much. A couple of questions on my end. One is, if -- Gustavo, any updates on the railway concession agreement? Similar to Mariana, that is a very important driver -- potential catalyst for the stock to move higher. So any of this will be very good. And also, you mentioned that in your prepared remarks that the iron ore cash cost declined significantly or did much better in June or toward the end of the quarter. Can you share with us what was the level of cash costs in June? Just to have a sense of the pace in order to model the trend in the second half of the year. Gustavo Pimenta -- Executive Vice President, Finance and Investor RelationsCarlos, let me do the second one and then Spinelli will go over the concession renewal discussions. So it was $22 per ton in June. So April, for us, we had some higher maintenance cost, which has impacted our performance in the quarter overall. But looking into June, we -- the performance improved substantially. It's down to $20 -- it was down to $22. That's what makes us feel highly confident in our ability to deliver within the guidance range of $21. 5 to $23 with a strong performance in the second half of the year. Marcello Spinelli -- Executive Vice President, Iron Ore SolutionsHi, Carlos. Thank you for [Technical Difficulty]Gustavo Pimenta -- Executive Vice President, Finance and Investor RelationsI'm going to take here because I think he lost his mic. So, Carlos, we continue to evolve. We don't have yet the final resolution to it. The conversations are, as we've mentioned in some of our market communications, highly advanced. There are certain regulatory procedures that needs to be followed. And so, we are waiting for those to be able to sell. We appreciate it's an important topic for our shareholders. And similar to Mariana, we think it's going to get resolved within the next couple of months. OperatorNext question comes from Leonardo Correa with BTG. You can open your microphone. Leonardo Correa -- BTG Pactual -- AnalystHello, everyone. Good morning. Yeah. So a couple of questions on my side. The first one on volumes, right? So there has been relevant progress, right, on iron ore production over the past quarters. 2024 seems to be in the bag, right? As Eduardo mentioned in the introduction, it's -- I mean, at the upper range of the guidance, which is welcome, right? Looking out to 2025, I understand that you guys can't give precise guidance yet. We're going to have to wait for Vale Day, but given that you have Vargem Grande, which is progressing well, it's supposed to add 15 million tons of additional capacity. And also Capanema, which is also another 15 million tons of capacity. Just wanted to hear you on how you think production can shape up 2025, if you have any information, I think, can help because everything of the story, at least in my view, depends on how production evolve can evolve from here. And obviously, that's going to have a big impact on fixed-cost dilution, right? So trying to understand the direction of volume is, I think, essential. The second point, for Gustavo, still on the cash return topic, right, Gustavo, we still haven't spoken about the theme yet in the conversation or I think we spoke less than we have in the past. I mean it was a good surprise to see net debt levels reduced this quarter given the proceeds from base metals. We're now under $15 billion of expanded net debt, which from hearing you over the past several quarters and years, it seems that close to $20 billion, you were uncomfortable and Vale was deviating a bit from the average of the industry, right, which was running below Vale on net debt to EBITDA. Now you're getting closer, you're at the low of the range in terms of target for you. So my question is, what needs to happen for Vale to move back to paying extraordinary dividends from here? I mean what needs -- what do you need to see? You need to see iron ore prices rebound? Or would you eventually be looking to increase leverage maybe to the middle of the range? Do you still need Samarco, what exactly is weighing on the decision process of Vale not paying the extraordinary? Those are the questions. Gustavo Pimenta -- Executive Vice President, Finance and Investor RelationsThanks, Leo. So I'll cover both. Yes, look, I think it's fair to say that the trend is upwards, right? So we are bringing those projects online. I mean we've talked about that at Vale Day, almost 50 million tons, if you sum the three of them. They are progressing super well within the time line that we had defined. So you should expect us to be able to continue to post a positive trend toward that long-term goal of being between 340 million to 360 million by 2026, right? So that's fair to assume that. And certainly, the details, as we usually do, we'll provide at Vale Day, but the trend is certainly positive in that regard -- in addition to the positive trend in the stability of our own operations, right, which have been performing well lately. So that's a positive news, we think. In terms of the dividend, extraordinary capital allocation, look, we -- you know the way we think about it, and we are always looking for ways to remunerate our shareholders within a very disciplined capital allocation framework. Certainly, there are a few things we want to see first. One is how the second half performs in terms of prices. That's important to see where we're going to land by year-end and also see how especially Mariana evolves. And then as we settle, we want to have that clarity first before making any further commitments. So those are important topics as part of our overall capital allocation framework that we want to see before we commit eventually incremental remuneration to our shareholders. OperatorOur next question comes from Caio Ribeiro with Bank of America. Caio, you can open your microphone. Caio Ribeiro -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- AnalystOK. Good morning. Thank you for the opportunity. So my first question, and I'm going back to your production guidance for the year, right? Second quarter numbers were quite strong. As you mentioned earlier in the call, your concern of attaining the upper end of the guidance. But it even seems feasible that you could surpass, right, that upper end of the guidance, right? So my question is, could you revise that guidance of eventually this year? And what are you looking for in terms of factors or things that would give you that confidence to do so? And are these factors, events more market related or operational in nature? And is there a particular timing that you would see as more likely to take this decision or not? And then my second question is a follow-up on the ongoing railroad concession renewal negotiations. The concession renewal process generally involves an upfront payment followed by some commitments to deliver investments in the railroad over time. So I just wanted to see whether you can provide any color. Once this agreement is struck, if that initial payment would be a single installment or several installments, right, followed by a capex commitment on the railroads over time or how we should think about this?Gustavo Pimenta -- Executive Vice President, Finance and Investor RelationsSo, Caio, thanks for your question. Gustavo here. Yes, I mean, if you look at year to date, we are performing well and better than last year. In fact, but we want to see how the next couple of months evolve. And then if there is an opportunity for us to do better, we'll do and we'll certainly up the market as we feel comfortable to update those numbers. But for now, team is highly focused on delivering what we committed. And given everything we've seen performance is super strong. Certainly, top end of the guidance is highly achievable for us. And if there's an opportunity to revisit, we will do in its due course. I think in terms of the details of the concession, I think it's early to say. Those are confidential conversations. We want to keep it within those dialogues. But certainly, we are looking at how any settlement fits into our cash flow projections and having the ability to honor those commitments, right? So that's super important in our conversations, but it is something we are still keeping within the negotiation team. OperatorNext question from Marcio Farid with Goldman Sachs. You can open your microphone. Marcio Farid -- Goldman Sachs -- AnalystHi. Good morning everyone. Thanks for the time. I have a quick follow-up here. Firstly, I think Spinelli talked a lot about the current situation in China in terms of where premiums and discounts are, but I was trying to understand how should we figure it out in the long term? Or is it clearly upward trend in terms of demand for high-grade products and agglomerates as well? And obviously, Vale is definitely going increase it all in that direction as well, right? I'm just trying to understand from you, I think in longer term, obviously, [Inaudible] coming online in our numbers, for capacity potentially only '27, '28 but still significant high-grade volumes. There is obviously a push for the Australian [Inaudible] to develop their own agglomerate with their own fines as well. So how should we think about the balance for premiums in the long term, given a scenario of growing demand. And maybe on the base metal side, obviously, nickel better quarter from a cost perspective, copper, not so much. How should we think about it? I think it's been volatile from our sourcing perspective and how much third party is being used or not, especially in Canada. But now, if Sossego come back online, Salobo. How should we think about the momentum for cost of the base metal side, please?Marcello Spinelli -- Executive Vice President, Iron Ore SolutionsThank you, Marcio, for your question. So our long-term strategy remained intact. We strongly believe that you're starting to face segmentation of the market, as you mentioned, with high-grade ores, agglomerated products, if you see today, the pellet feed for high-grade ore or direct reduction is -- we may consider that a very strategic material in the world. t's not about copper, but high-grade ore is very rare. And we still see a gap in demand and production in the following years. You mentioned our competitors. They don't have ore that can be concentrated to reach these high-quality ores. So direct reduction is a trend. Natural gas is a trend. So following this, we see our Mega Hubs strategy going forward. This announcement today about the mega hub in Sohar, actually is the first mega hub, full mega hub already done. So we are now -- we have to build this capacity to concentrate. But there, we have the port, and we have -- we can handle the products and we can produce the agglomerate. So that's the first mega hub. In the U. S. , it's moving fast after the grant that we got in the first half. And so far, other regions like Oman or Abu Dhabi and Saudi is moving really fast. And actually, in a few hours going to receive here the Minister of Saudi to talk about this. Minister of Industry and Mining. So we're really confident about this trend and remain intact in our strategy. OperatorNext question from Yuri Pereira with Santander. Gustavo Pimenta -- Executive Vice President, Finance and Investor RelationsNo, no, no. Eduardo de Salles Bartolomeo -- Chief Executive OfficerWe still have to answer the other question. Mark Cutifani is going to take the question. Go ahead, Mark, please. Mark Cutifani -- Executive Vice President, Base MetalsYes. You got me now. So thanks for the question. On nickel, the trend should continue to improve with summary mine volumes continuing to improve. In fact, we're up near 20% increase as we tracked into June. So good news in Sudbury is we've got a lot more mine fleet. So that's a real positive. Just come back from Voisey's Bay, the trends there are very good. We should continue to improve with Onca Puma, getting the second furnace up. So I think the trends are all positive on the nickel front. We've got to keep working hard at Manitoba, getting the place settled and looking at what we can do to reduce the services that we can probably do from other places. So we're working on all of those fronts. On the copper side, Salobo is the key. It is impacted by grades. If we can open the pit up a bit more and continue to improve our pit productivities, we can probably do a little bit more on the grade front, but that will take a little bit of time. It will depend on our in-pit productivity during the year. And Sossego is about settling post the restart and making sure that we've got the feed mix right during the course of the next 18 months. Thanks. OperatorOK. Now next question from Yuri Pereira with Santander. Yuri Pereira -- Banco Santander -- AnalystHi, guys. Thanks for having my question. Could you talk about depletion, not only for Vale, but also for the industry. I mean, how many tons you think are out of the market per year only from depletion?Marcello Spinelli -- Executive Vice President, Iron Ore SolutionsThank you, Yuri, for your questions. It's a tough question because this is the business. So but I can give you color that globally, we have a decrease of quality. And mainly in our competitors, they are facing the increase of alumina. That's a huge impact that will come to the market. In Brazil, I can say from Vale, the depletion is something that we had to overcome after Brumadinho. So we had to improve our capacity not only to support this decline of the mines, that's a natural thing. But even grow the capacity to establish our level. So globally, if I can give you a number, it's 300 million tons to 400 million tons until 2030. And again, the difficulties to bring back quality puts Vale on a very good level to compete in this new world of green energy. OperatorNext question from Ricardo Monegaglia with Safra. You can open your microphone. Ricardo Monegaglia -- Safra -- AnalystHello, everyone. Good morning. I have a couple of quick questions. First on -- regards to the lawsuits in the U. K. and Netherlands. Are there any discussions to include such in some sort in the final agreement from Mariana, is that a possibility? Second question is how much could you -- could Vargem Grande produce in 2024 and how those grades in that operation compare with your most recent figures on quality of content. And maybe if Mark could just give a quick outlook or his latest impressions on nickel and copper markets. Gustavo Pimenta -- Executive Vice President, Finance and Investor RelationsRicardo, Gustavo here. So I'll do the first two and then Carlos will cover the second and then we can have Mark complementing. So look, on the lawsuit, they are different, right? So those are different jurisdictions and the U. K. and the Netherlands as compared to Brazil. We continue to believe that the right jurisdiction for this decision to be handled, settled and resolved, this is Brazil, and we are working toward that outcome. As I mentioned in my first answer today, we continue to be optimistic that we'll be able to resolve those conversations and discussions here in Brazil. Carlos Medeiros -- Executive Vice President, OperationsRicardo, this is Carlos Medeiros speaking. On Vargem Grande, we expect to produce 1 million tons in the remainder part of the year, and should be a normal concentrated product, 62% iron. Eduardo de Salles Bartolomeo -- Chief Executive OfficerMark?Mark Cutifani -- Executive Vice President, Base MetalsWell, good. Look, I think the world, as we know, is short copper demand still looks pretty strong. A little bit of a slowing of EV demand, but I don't think that's significant in the scheme of things. I think all other markets are pretty strong. So we believe copper will continue to play strongly. And I think the activity we're seeing across the industry in terms of interest in copper assets is really confirming how strong, I think the producers are. We're the same. We've got some opportunities to improve. North Atlantic should also do a little bit better on copper next year, but I think pretty positive. And I think the risk is to the upside. OperatorNext question from Amos Fletcher with Barclays. You can open your microphone. Amos Fletcher -- AnalystYeah. Good morning, guys. Thanks for the opportunity. My first question was just on working capital. I was just wanting to ask about how big of a release we can potentially expect in terms of working capital in H2, as Gustavo was mentioning. And then the second question was on nickel production in the guidance. The bottom end of the guidance implies 40% higher production in H2 versus H1. Just wanted to ask what are the main drivers for delivering that big recovery that we should be expecting. All right. Thanks very much. Gustavo Pimenta -- Executive Vice President, Finance and Investor RelationsSo, Amos, this is Gustavo. Look, on working capital, I think there is a possibility to revert, if not all of it, but most of it, as we highlighted in that chart. So I think we are looking for a stronger Q3. I think that's what you should be seeing. Mark Cutifani -- Executive Vice President, Base MetalsOn nickel production, the good news, Amos, is that Sudbury has got quite a bit of ore in front of the mill, something we haven't had for a long time. So that's positive in terms of coming out of the maintenance, so probably 10,000 to 15,000 ton, pickup there. Thompson should do better with a bit of production held back through Long Harbour maintenance. There's probably three there. Voisey's Bay, again, impacted by Long Harbour maintenance. So there's probably three or four there. And we've got a little bit more that we can square through on the third parties because of the other maintenance that we've had in smelters. So I think overall, pretty strong. And obviously, Onca Puma should be a stronger contributor, probably at least 10 based on the bringing up of the furnace rebuild. So quite a few positives there. The only negative might be -- what will be the deconsolidation of PTVI. I think there's about two there. So net-net, we should go from about what was it, 67 to probably a pickup of around 30 in the second half. That's what we're assuming at the moment, that outlooks. We're pretty comfortable with that at the moment. OperatorThank you. This concludes today's question-and-answer session. We would like to hand the floor back to Mr. Eduardo Bartolomeo for the company's final remarks. Eduardo de Salles Bartolomeo -- Chief Executive OfficerOK. Thank you. Well, as I mentioned in my initial remarks, the first half of the year is over. The best is yet to come. I think we are really confident on delivering on our strategic guidance. I think safety is one of the things we're most proud of and we are truly all extremely well on that, as I mentioned before, I think on iron ore cost is going to come to its place where Gustavo mentioned and production, for sure. It's on our hands. The things on direct reduction, as Gustavo mentioned, as a key takeaway, is coming on to reality as penal mentioned, we announced the Oman concentration plant. One thing that makes me very happy is the contract of our new CEO at Base Metals. Shaun is going to do a great job, help Mark do the transformation that is needed there. And as you said, Gustavo has mentioned in his final remarks, we are always committed to create value. So I will end, like always, I have never been so optimistic and that's why I'm optimistic. We are delivering on what we are -- how can I say that, promising to the market and that makes us happy. And of course, I'd like to thank our employees, our team for that, OK? And you, of course, for having to interest and talking to us. Until the next call.

      "(Bloomberg) -- Vale SA, the world’s second-biggest iron ore supplier, posted second-quarter results that slightly trailed analyst estimates after facing higher expenses. Most Read from BloombergTrump Risks Losing Voters He Needs With Loaded Attacks on HarrisParis Trains Hit By Sabotage Hours Before Olympics Kick OffHarris Just Showed Why Trump Is So Afraid of HerTrump Won’t Commit to Debate Until Harris Formally NominatedGreat Rotation Trade Sees Investors Dump AI Giants for Less Obvious StocksThe Rio de Janeiro-based company is struggling with rising costs at a time when the iron-ore market has also been weak, partly because of a demand slump in China. Vale said Thursday that higher expenses from freight and maintenance activities weighed on its earnings. The company reported proforma adjusted earnings before items of $3. 99 billion in the quarter, missing the $4. 07 billion average analyst estimate. “As expected, cost performance continues to weigh on the negative side,” Daniel Sasson, an analyst at Itau BBA, said in a note to clients. “Operating cash generation was also weak, mainly due to the consumption of working capital. ”Still, Vale and other major iron ore companies are seeing an advantage in production costs compared with junior miners. On a net basis, Vale’s profit more than tripled compared with a year earlier. Brazil’s mining giant sold a larger share of lower-grade products in the quarter, which also tempered gains driven by robust output from its biggest mine in the north of the country. Vale said earlier this month it mined 80. 6 million tons of iron ore in the quarter, 2. 4% higher than the same period a year ago. Iron ore is one of the year’s worst performing major commodities, slumping more than 25% as China’s property crisis hurts demand and big miners keep adding volumes to the seaborne market. Vale gets about 90% of its revenues from the steelmaling staple. Vale also announced a partnership to build a concentration plant in Sohar, Oman, with an initial production capacity of 12 million tons a year of high-grade iron ore concentrates. The plant will feed Vale’s pellet plants and future briquette plants in the region, with startup expected for 2027. The company said it will return 8. 9 billion reais ($1. 6 billion) to shareholders in interest on capital, to be paid in September. Vale shares were little changed in after-hours trading on Thursday. The stock trades at a discount compared with other major miners due to company-specific issues. Vale is still dealing with the fallout of a 2015 tailings dam disaster on Samarco, an iron ore venture with BHP Group. The company expected to reach a final settlement last month, but negotiations with Brazilian authorities are still ongoing. Vale has also been navigating through a tumultuous leadership change, with Chief Executive Officer Eduardo Bartolomeo holding the top post through December while the search for a successor continues. The next CEO will be selected from three shortlisted names that will be passed on by a consulting firm by the end of September.

      "Streaming giants Disney (DIS) and Paramount (PARA, PARAA) both reported earnings this week. Disney reported an earnings beat on both the top and bottom lines for its fiscal third quarter, revealing its streaming segment was profitable for the first time. Paramount Global (PARA, PARAA) reported mixed results for its second quarter, with adjusted earnings beating estimates, but revenue falling short of expectations. Morningstar Senior Equity Analyst Matthew Dolgin joins Yahoo Finance to discuss the streaming landscape. \"All these companies other than Netflix (NFLX) are continuing to make progress, but they are just not there, not mature,\" Dolgin notes, \"the difference with them and Netflix, a decade or less ago, is that they have these other legacy businesses that they're managing. And so they're not getting the pass from Wall Street as streaming continues to grow and is not yet a mature or good business necessarily. They're seeing their other business decline, so they need that to turn. \"\"With that said, we're pretty optimistic generally about how things are going in the streaming space,\" Dolgin adds, \"they're making it a better business, but it takes time and in the meantime, their other businesses continue to struggle and that's why the stocks, we think, are remaining under significant pressure. \"Watch the video above to hear why Dolgin doesn't think YouTube posts a \"really big\" threat to streamers yet.

      "It was a brutal week for the value of the cable bundle, as Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) and Paramount Global (PARA) both took significant write-downs on just how much their respective cable businesses are worth. On Wednesday, WBD reported a massive $9. 1 billion impairment charge related to its TV networks unit following the loss of a key media rights deal with the NBA. It was a similar story for Paramount, which said Thursday it took a nearly $6 billion write-down on the value of its cable business, citing \"recent indicators in the linear affiliate marketplace. \"The back-to-back moves highlight the struggles within the industry as more consumers cut the cord and companies focus their efforts on streaming. But that undertaking has proven to be quite challenging. And while Paramount — along with Disney (DIS) — reported a profitable quarter for its streaming unit this week, investor skepticism over the industry's path forward remains clear. All three stocks are down year to date against an 11% gain for the S&P 500 (^GSPC). Over the last year, Warner Bros. stock is down 50% while Paramount has lost a third of its value. For years, linear advertising and affiliate fees had consistently boosted revenues for these networks. The shifting to streaming saw cable subscribers decline, hurting affiliate fees, and streaming companies now entering the ad market have taken another leg out of the stool. \"The timing of these impairment charges comes as Paramount and Warner are under increased strain from their outsized debt loads,\" Third Bridge analyst Jamie Lumley wrote in an email to Yahoo Finance. \"The impact to their tax obligations is certainly a factor as both companies look for any opportunity to stabilize their balance sheets. \"Lumley added, \"The writing has been on the wall that cable businesses are not going to recover from their revenue and profitability slides. \"Although profitability has improved, the pressure from deteriorating linear networks, coupled with heavy debt loads, has forced legacy media giants to cut costs. Warner Bros. has scrapped multiple projects. Paramount said Thursday it plans to lay off another 15% of its workforce. Disney restructured its entire business. And virtually all of the major streaming giants have raised prices at a time when the consumer is becoming more choosy, with churn rates hovering at elevated levels. KeyBanc analyst Brandon Nispel said recent strategies from Paramount and others seem \"to center around shrinking to survive, where the potential growth of the business is likely to be challenged. \"Rumors have swirled when it comes to future strategic options, which could include sales and splits. Paramount, for its part, is currently going through the process of being acquired by Skydance, with the company saying this week it expects the deal to close in the second quarter of next year. And with impairment charges making the financing demands of a takeout lower, perhaps now is the time for these companies to start cleaning up their balance sheets. \"For Paramount and Warner, both companies have seen double-digit declines in advertising and distribution revenue for years,\" Third Bridge's Lumley said. \"These write-downs, while significant in size, do not come as a major surprise given the pressure this industry has continued to face. . . . In terms of future write-downs, it would not be surprising to see further reevaluations across the industry of the value of cable businesses. \"Alexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

      "The US equity market (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC) and bitcoin (BTC-USD) in the crypto space both aim to start the trading day off right, bouncing back from this week's sell-off.
